<p><strong>SYNTAX</strong></p>

<pre><code>post_88_gmp_death(p,a,r,e,m) 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EXPLANATION</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>a - is a single character field that takes the value ‘Y’ or ‘N’. It denotes whether
to include any transferred-in GMP in the GMP calculations</li>
  <li>p - is a single character field that denotes the type of GMP revaluation as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>L - Limited rate revaluation</li>
      <li>F - Fixed rate revaluation</li>
      <li>S - Section 148 orders. These are assumed to be the same as for Fixed Rate revaluation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>r - is a single character field that takes the value ‘Y’ or ‘N’. It denotes whether to include an additional revaluation year in the GMP calculations.</li>
  <li>e - is a single character field that takes the value ‘Y’ or ‘N’. It denotes whether to use equalisation when calculating female SPA.</li>
  <li>m - is a single character field that takes the value ‘Y’ or ‘N’. It denotes whether to use equalisation when calculating male SPA.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Date of death is taken as the current calculation date.</li>
  <li>If Date Left on the Member Basic Details screen is blank, it is assumed that you wish
to calculate a death in service GMP. Otherwise it is assumed it will be a death in
deferment GMP.</li>
  <li>If date of death is later than State Pension Date then the GMP is revalued up to State
Pension Date using Fixed, Limited or Section 148 orders, and between State Pension
Date and Normal Retirement Date at 1/7% per week, providing the period between State
Pension Date and Normal Pension Date is at least seven weeks.</li>
