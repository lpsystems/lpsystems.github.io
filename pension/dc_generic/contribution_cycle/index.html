<p>This document aims to set out the regular contribution processing cycle in Pension
Master. It does this as a step by step list of activities you need to do to process
regular contributions, some of which may not be applicable to all schemes.</p>

<p>To view a printable checklist, click <a href="/pension/dc_generic/checklist/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="contribution-request-run">Contribution Request Run</h2>

<p>This <a href="/pension/investments/contribution_entry/peu_cont/">program</a> calculates expected contributions for a specified
group of members. If successful, these are loaded into a Contribution Batch for onward
processing.</p>

<p>It is intended that you send the schedule produced by this program to your client
to request the contributions that are then due. The client should then ensure they
deduct these contributions from the member and send you full details. These will then
be reconciled against what was expected in Batch Data Input.</p>

<h2 id="allocate-contributions">Allocate Contributions</h2>

<p>This <a href="/pension/investments/allocate_contributions/peu_alloc/">program</a> allows you to allocate contributions to
investment funds as per the members current investment choice.</p>

<p>A <a href="/pension/investments/allocate_contributions/per_alloc/">report</a> is available to produce a list of any contributions
that have not yet been allocated to investment funds for a selected group of members.</p>

<h2 id="unit-posting">Unit Posting</h2>

<p>This <a href="/pension/investments/unit_posting/peu_post/">program</a> allows you to post allocated contributions
to units.</p>

<p>A <a href="/pension/investments/unit_posting/per_post/">report</a> is available to produce a list of any investment
history entries that have not yet had units posted for a selected group of members.</p>

<h2 id="switches">Switches</h2>

<p>This <a href="/pension/investments/switches/peu_switch/">program</a> allows you to switch a member (or group
of members) investments from one set of investment funds to another. It allows the
option of one to many, many to many or many to one with regard to switching from old
fund(s) to new fund(s).</p>

<p>This <a href="/pension/investments/switches/per_switch/">report</a> allows you to produce a list of any switches
that have been instigated for the selected group of members, where the money has not
yet been dis-invested from the old investment fund.</p>

<h2 id="asset-transfer">Asset Transfer</h2>

<p>This <a href="/pension/investments/peu_asset/">program</a> allows you to transfer the existing units
for a member to the scheme suspense account. It will transfer all units for a member
to the scheme suspense account and write a negative unit entry to each of the members
funds so that the members total unit holdings will be zero.</p>

<h2 id="asset-balance">Asset Balance</h2>

<p>This <a href="/pension/investments/peu_assbal/">program</a> allows you to reconcile total units for
a fund against those recorded on Pension Master. Any difference between the two values
is written to the scheme suspense account.</p>

<h2 id="fund-balancing">Fund Balancing</h2>

<p>This <a href="/pension/investments/peu_fbal/">program</a> allows you to report on members who have
had a lifestyle event since the last date they invested contributions. It shows you
the current allocation of the members investments, and the proposed new split of investments
after re-investing according to the appropriate lifestyle matrix.</p>

<h2 id="bulk-fund-redirection">Bulk Fund Redirection</h2>

<p>This <a href="/pension/investments/peu_binvch/">program</a> enables you to add or remove a investment
setup details to a selection of members in one step.</p>

<h2 id="units-listing-report">Units Listing Report</h2>

<p>This <a href="/pension/reports/standard_reports/per_units/">program</a> allows you to produce a list of contributions
and units for the selected group of members between two user entered dates.</p>
