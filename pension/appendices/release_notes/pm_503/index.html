      <h2>Details Of The Changes
</h2>
<ol>
<li>
    In the <i>Salary History</i>, <i>Contribution History</i> and <i>Units History</i> screens
    of <i>Member File Maintenance</i>, check that the history date entered is not less
    than the date the member joined the scheme (<i>pm_dps</i>)., If it is, display an
    error message and ask the user if they really intend to use this date. 
</li>
<li>
    Added postcode field to <i>Company File Maintenance</i> and amended <i>Letter/Cert</i> option
    to reflect this. 
</li>
<li>
    Added <i>Status Code</i> to the list of possible membership selection criteria in <i>Pensionable
    Salary Update</i> program. 
</li>
<li>
    Added <i>Status Type</i> and <i>Special Code</i> to the list of possible selection
    criteria when searching for a member record in <i>Member File Maintenance</i>. Also
    added an <i>F8</i> lookup facility on the <i>Special Code</i> field. 
</li>
<li>
    Added <i>Calculation Trace Report</i> to both <i>Member File Maintenance</i> and <i>Batch
    Quotation Run</i> so that every time you run a calculation on <i>Pension Master</i>,
    a report is produced showing for each member and each formula, the formula lines processed
    together with intermediate results for each formula line. 
</li>
<li>
    Extended <i>Label Printing Facility</i> in <i>Member File Maintenance</i> to give
    more flexibility in output. First of all, the user can choose to print on to a single
    strip of labels, as before, or on to a laser sheet (2*4) similar to an Avery L7165
    sheet. The user is no longer restricted to just producing labels showing the members
    name and address in company order. A free text header line is available followed by
    six lines of selected data fields (eight line with the laser sheet option) from the
    Members Basic and Address records and Scheme, Company and Category descriptions. The
    labels are automatically sorted in alpha order but the user can extend this sort using
    scheme code, company code and/or category code. All selections have a <i>F8</i> lookup
    facility and basic help text attached. 
</li>
<li>
    Added report code, description and scheme code and description to the header of the <i>Mail-Merge
    Variable Definition Report</i> produced by the <i>Mail-Merge Integration Report</i> at
    the request of Mark Winstanley. 
</li>
<li>
    Allow use of <i>F2</i> key to delete lines of contribution details in the <i>Contribution
    Hiostory</i> screen of <i>Member File Maintenance</i>. This is allowable in the following
    circumstances: 
    <ul>
	<li>
	    If the scheme is a defined benefits scheme. 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Otherwise, if the unitposting flag for that contribution entry is set to "N" i.e.
	    if that contribution has not yet been used to purchase units. 
	</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>
    Fixed bug in <i>Quotation Screen</i> of <i>Member File Maintenance</i> where current
    and previous quote dates were not being written back to the database prior to the
    calculations being run, possibly resulting in last time's quotation dates being used
    in any calculations that depend on quote dates. This is not expected to affect many
    users as most formulae depend on termination date and not quote date. 
</li>
<li>
    Display batch date, scheme code and scheme name at the top of the second screen in <i>Batch
    Data Input</i> so as to make it clearer to the user which batch they are inputting. 
</li>
<li>
    In the <i>Salary</i> section of <i>Batch Data Input</i>, the pop-up deducible window
    for <i>Pensionable Salary</i> now appears not only when the <i>Pensionable Salary</i> is
    blank, but also when it is zero. This is to aid input of salaries when returning to
    a previosly saved salary batch in the situation where you have not completed entering
    the salaries prior to saving the batch. 
</li>
<li>
    Added prinouts of investment funds &gt; 0 to the report option when inputting a <i>Contribution
    Batch</i> in <i>Batch Data Input</i>. This enables the user to check things like expenses
    and allocations to individual funds that were not previously available at this stage. 
</li>
<li>
    Contributions screen report in <i>Member File Maintenance</i> now prints details of
    the breakdown of any expenses for each contribution source and defaults to printing
    in landscape mode. 
</li>
<li>
    Added <i>Contribution History</i> and <i>Unit History</i> to the <i>Full Member Report</i> in <i>Member
    File Maintenance</i>. 
</li>
<li>
    User can now select date fields <i>pds_date</i>, <i>pdb_date</i> and <i>ptv_date</i> using
    the <i>defsal()</i>, <i>defhst()</i> and <i>transfer()</i>functions in <i>Formula
    File Maintenance</i>. 
</li>
</ol>
