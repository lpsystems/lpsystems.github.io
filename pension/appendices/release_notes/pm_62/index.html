	    The existing Deferred Pensioner screen has been replaced by 3 new screens as follows:
	    <p>
		<b>Screen 1 - Basic Deferred Pensioner Details Screen</b> 
	    </p>
	    <p>
		This contains typical deferred pensioner data that relates to the members Deferred
		Pension benefits. Information such as, the Date the first Payment is Due, values relating
		to Inland Revenue Maximum Pension/Cash and Scheme Cash, Cessation Details and the
		Payment Frequency. Also an additional 5 fields are available that can be defined by
		the user. Data must be entered on this screen before the 2 other screens can be accessed.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		<b>Note: The Payment Frequency will be set to 12 (Monthly) by default for any existing
		Deferred Pensioners.</b> 
	    </p>
	    <p>
		<b>Screen 2 - Deferred Pension History Screen</b> 
	    </p>
	    <p>
		This is used to record any changes in the members Deferred Pension benefit. Deferred
		Pension Codes are used to indicate whether the values are Added/Ignored or Subtracted
		from the calculation of the members total Deferred Pension. Other information can
		also be entered such as, the Date the change is due to Commence, the Date of Last
		Increase and values for the members Initial/Current Pension and benefit for Spouses
		before and after the normal pension date.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		<b>Screen 3 - Deferred Pension Increase History Screen</b> 
	    </p>
	    <p>
		This historically records any changes made to a members Deferred Pension benefit on
		the Deferred Pension History Screen. The last 10 alterations made to a Deferred Pension
		Code are displayed on the screen with options on the menu to allow any other codes
		to be shown. Information such as the value of the members Pension and any Spouses
		Benefit before and after the normal pension date are recorded.

	    Formulae can now produce 3 new types of result as well as the standard decimal format.
	    The possible types of result are as follows:
		<table cols="2" width="50%" border="0">
		    <tbody>
			<tr>
			    <td>
				Decimal</td>
			    <td>
				a numeric value e.g. 1234.56</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			    <td>
				Date</td>
			    <td>
				a valid date e.g. 01/12/1999</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			    <td>
				Integer</td>
			    <td>
				a numeric value with no decimal places e.g. 1234</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			    <td>
				Character</td>
			    <td>
				a string up to 100 alphabetic or numeric characters e.g. Mr G. Marx</td>
			</tr>
		    </tbody>
		</table>
	    The type of result will depend upon the first section of the formula line.
	    <p>
		For example, if 'Pensioner' is the first section of the line then the line is set
		as a character line. Also if #pm_surname is the first part of the line, or any function
		returns a character value then the line is a character line. This means that numeric
		operators cannot be used on the line or the result of this line. e.g.
	    </p>
		<table cols="2" width="50%" border="0">
		    <tbody>
			<tr>
			    <td width="10%">
				1</td>
			    <td>
				#pm_surname</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			    <td>
				2</td>
			    <td>
				@1 * 5</td>
			</tr>

			    <td>
				3</td>

				result @2</td>

	    When this formula is run it would produce a warning on the Warnings Report saying

	    This module can be found on the Updates sub-menu. It allows the user to load

	    By entering in the required details through the selection criteria, the program will
	    firstly check that the details are correctly entered. Secondly, the fields which
	    make up the data lines within the data file will be checked for the correct format.

		The program has one main objective which is to load up renewal data provided by the

	    The Pension Increase Run has been changed to integrate with the new Pensioner and Deferred

	    <p>
		New pension values can now be calculated based upon either a percentage rate or the
		result of a formula. Care must be taken to ensure that the formula generates only
		the increase for the period. An extra option has been included to allow increases
		to be calculated on a pro rata basis.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		The program is split into 4 main sections described as follows:
	    </p>
		<table cellspacing="0">
		    <tbody>
			<tr>
			    <td>
				Provisional</td>
			    <td>

				This allows an increase run to be performed and <b>does update</b> the Pension/Deferred

			</tr>
			<tr>
			    <td>

		</table>
	    <p>The members that are increased can be selected using standard selection
	    criteria (i.e. Scheme, Company, Category, Status, Special Code and Member). From
	    the members selected a list of the Pension Codes currently used is displayed allowing
	    either all the codes to be updated with a global Formula/Fixed Rate or to be increased
	    individually.</p>
	    <p>
		The information used to select the members and the specific increase information used
		against each Pension Code can be saved as an individual set of parameters (known as
		a Pension Increase parameter Set). These parameters are specific to each scheme and
		each pension type, for either Deferred Pension or Pension increases. This allows them
		to be saved, using a descriptive name, for future use.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		A report is generated if exceptions are found during the Provisional or Actual Increase
		Run. This shows the members details, the options that have been selected and the reason
		why the update was not processed. An increase report is created showing the members
		pension values, that have been correctly calculated, before and after the Pension
		Increase Run. 
	    </p>

		See the Pension Increase Run page for further
		details.

	    The existing Pensioner screen has been replaced by 4 new screens as follows:
	    <p>
		<b>Screen 1 - Basic Pensioner Details Screen</b> 
	    </p>
	    <p>
		This contains typical pensioner data that relates to the members Pension benefits.
		Information such as, Retirement Date and the Date the Pension Commenced, Commutation
		and Lump Sum details, Cessation Details and Payment and Pension Provider details.
		Also an additional 5 fields are available that can be defined by the user. Data must
		be entered on this screen before the 4 other screens can be accessed.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		<b>Note: The Payment Frequency will be set to 12 (Monthly) by default for any existing
		Pensioners.</b> 
	    </p>
	    <p>
		<b>Screen 2 - Pension History Screen</b> 
	    </p>
	    <p>
		This is used to record any changes in the members Pension benefit. Pension Codes are
		used to indicate whether the values are Added/Ignored or Subtracted from the calculation
		of the members total Pension. Other information can also be entered such as, the Date
		the change is due to Commence, the Date of Last Increase and values for the members
		Initial/Current Pension and benefit for Spouses.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		<b>Screen 3 - Pension Increase History Screen</b> 
	    </p>
	    <p>
		This historically records any changes made to a members Pension benefit on the Pension
		History Screen. The last 10 alterations made to a Pension Code are displayed on the
		screen with options on the menu to allow any other codes to be shown. Information
		such as the value of the members Pension and any Spouses Benefit before and after
		the normal pension date are recorded.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		<b>Screen 4 - Pensioner Bank Details Screen</b> 
	    </p>
	    <p>
		This allows the members Bank/Building Society information to be held, allowing data
		to be exported to a Pensioner Payroll system. The data includes the Bank/Building
		Society Name and Address details, the members Account information and the Roll Number
		required by a Building Society.

				<p>Ensure that all administrators are aware that a note has been written to Scheme
				Notes detailing any formula lines that reference redundant Pensioner data fields.
