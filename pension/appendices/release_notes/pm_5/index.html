      <h2>Introduction
</h2>
<p>
This is a major new release of <i>Pension Master</i> packed with new features that
both extend the capabilities of the software and make it easier to use. The main changes
can be summarised as follows: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Introduced a <i>Quotation Type</i> feature so as you can group together logical sets
    of benefit calculation formulae. 
</li>
<li>
    Re-designed <i>Formula File Maintenance</i> so as to allow an unlimited number of
    lines of formula code per formula. The <i>F1</i> and <i>F2</i> keys are now available
    for inserting/deleting lines of formulae, with appropriate re-numbering of subsequent
    formula lines. 
</li>
<li>
    Replaced the old <i>Age/Sex Factor Table</i> and <i>Term Related Factor Table</i> modules
    with a new improved <i>Factor Table Maintenance</i> program. 
</li>
<li>
    Integrated <i>Workflow Management</i> facilities are now built into <i>Pension Master</i>. 
</li>
<li>
    Added a new <i>Renewal Data Request</i> report allowing you to print off blank end
    of year renewal returns for sending out to clients. 
</li>
<li>
    Formulae can now be directly accessed from the <i>Member Report</i>, <i>Full Members
    Listing</i> and <i>Mail-Merge Integration Report</i> rather than having to run a <i>Batch
    Quotation Run</i> prior to running your report. 
</li>
<li>
    You can now access more database tables using the <i>Member Report</i>, <i>Full Members
    Listing</i> and <i>Mail-Merge Integration Report</i>. This will allow you, for example,
    to print out units from more than one investment fund on the same report. 
</li>
<li>
    Introduced new <i>Letter/Cert</i> option in <i>Company File Maintenance</i> for sending
    out mail-merges to companies within a scheme. 
</li>
<li>
    Added new <i>Salary Listing Report</i> to allow you to print off salary details for
    a selected group of members for a specified date. 
</li>
<li>
    Added new <i>Investment Value Summary Run</i> to allow you to update a batch of members <i>Investment
    Value Summary</i> screens in <i>Member File Maintenance</i> and to print off a report
    showing up to date investment values for a selected group of members, based on either
    a unit bid or offer price. 
</li>
<li>
    You can now automatically generate a list of relevant members when adding a batch
    in the <i>Batch Data Entry</i> module. This will save you time as you will not have
    to input the member number on each line of data you input. 
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details Of The Changes
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
    Added <i>F8</i> lookup facility to <i>Unit Posting</i> program on <i>Scheme</i>, <i>Company</i>, <i>Category</i> and <i>Status</i> fields. 
</li>
<li>
    Removed old <i>pe_num</i>, <i>pe_bnum</i> and <i>pe_nxtsch</i> database tables and
    modified all programs accordingly. These tables used to hold the values for the next
    member number, batch number and scheme number respectively. The programs now default
    these fields to 0 when adding a member, batch or scheme respectively and when <i>Esc</i> is
    pressed to save the details, the relevant member, batch or scheme number is displayed
    to the screen and used to save the record accordingly. 
</li>
<li>
    <br />
    This removes the old problem of, say, when adding a new member, the next member number
    is displayed to the screen, but if you subsequently press <i>Del</i> to abort the
    input of the new member, the next time you go to add a member, the last member number
    has been skipped over. i.e. we are now ensuring a strict sequence of consecutive member
    numbers. 
</li>
<li>
    Changed <i>List</i> report in <i>Scheme File Maintenance</i> so that each new scheme
    is not started on a new page i.e. schemes are now listed consecutively, one after
    the other. 
</li>
<li><p>Added facility to call formulae instead of fieldnames when processing a <i>Member
    Report</i>, <i>Full Members Listing Report</i> or a <i>Mail-Merge Integration Report</i>.
    This is done by entering the following syntax:</p>
    <p>#calc(formula_code)</p>
    <p>
	where <i>formula_code</i> is a 3 character formula code for the current scheme. The
	formula code will be syntax checked on entry and if it does not exist for the scheme
	implied by the current selection criteria, an error message will be displayed and
	you will have to re-enter a valid formula code. 
	<br />
	The formula corresponding to the formula code you entered will be dynamically calculated
	and output to the report as the report is running, thus removing the necessity to
	remember to run some quotes before using either of these three reports. 
    </p>
    <div class="info">
		    <p>This will not affect the quotation values that are displayed on the <i>Quotation
		    Screens</i> in <i>Member File Maintenance</i>.</p>
    </div>
</li>
<li>
    <i>Member Report</i>, <i>Full Members Listing Report</i> and <i>Mail-Merge Integration
    Report</i> now show the current member number being processed to the top of the screen
    so as to give you some idea of the progress of the report. 
</li>
<li>
    Added an <i>F8</i> lookup for <i>Formula Code</i> to <i>Member Report</i>, <i>Full
    Members Listing Report</i> and <i>Mail-Merge Integration Report</i>. In the report
    fields screen, the default <i>F8</i> lookup is for fieldname, but if you have any
    field beginning with the <i>#</i> symbol, the lookup changes to that of a valid formula
    code for the scheme implied by the current selection criteria and once the formula
    code is selected from the lookup, the line is written back to the screen field in
    the <i>#calc(formula_code)</i> format. 
</li>
<li>
    Added an <i>F8</i> lookup for <i>Scheme Code</i>, <i>Company Code</i>, <i>Category
    Code</i> and <i>Status Code</i> to <i>Member Report</i>, <i>Full Members Listing Report</i> and <i>Mail-Merge
    Integration Report</i>. 
</li>
<li>
    Extended <i>F9</i> context-sensitive help displays in the <i>Member Report</i>, <i>Full
    Members Listing Report</i> and <i>Mail-Merge Integration Report</i>. 
</li>
<li>
    Added an <i>F8</i> lookup for the six <i>Group By</i> fields in the <i>Member Report</i>, <i>Full
    Members Listing Report</i> and <i>Mail-Merge Integration Report</i>. This lookup is
    restricted to the <i>Member File (pe_mem)</i> as the user is only permitted to sort
    records by fields on this table in these reports. 
</li>
<li>
    Added facility to pass arguments when using certain fields in the <i>Member Report</i>, <i>Full
    Members Listing Report</i> and <i>Mail-Merge Integration Report</i>. This allows you,
    for example to select unit totals from a particular investment fund, which was previously
    not possible using <i>Pension Master</i>. Details of the arguments required are shown
    in the following table: 
    <table cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
	    <tr>
		<th>
		    Table</th>
		<th>
		    Description</th>

	    </tr>
	</tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
	As an example, say you wanted to print a benefit statement with the first five nominated
	beneficiaries for each member (by reference to the <i>pe_dep</i> database table),
	you would enter: 
    </p>
    <p>pd_dep(1)</p>
    <p>
	to select the first dependants name, and just add four extra fields to the report
	to select each of the other dependants in turn. 
	<br />
	The syntax of the arguments is checked by the report as you add the fieldname and
	you will be warned of any errors or inconsistencies if and when they occur. 
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    Replaced the old <i>Age Related Factors</i> and <i>Term Related Factors</i> programs
    by a new improved <i>Factor File Maintenance</i> program. This copes with both of
    the old factor table types and allows more efficient use of the indices for each factor.
    Previously, if you have a table of factors, say from age 20 to 60, and decided that
    you really needed factors down to age 18, the extra ages would have to be added to
    the end of the table, after the factor for age 60. This lead to some strange screen
    displays as the factors could not be displayed in age order. 
</li>
<li>
    This is now fixed and we have introduced two new fields, <i>Range From</i> and <i>Range
    To</i> to the factor table header. These are to be used to adjust the range of ages
    (or terms) for your factors as you are no longer permitted to actually edit the ages
    (or terms) directly. 
    <br />
    Simply changing either of these fields for an existing factor table will cause the
    factors to be adjusted so as they only related to all ages (or terms) between the
    new values for <i>Range From</i> and <i>Range To</i>. If this results in new factors
    being added, they are defaulted to zero and you will be required to fill in their
    values for each new index. 
    <br />
    If any of the factors are zero when you try to save your factor table, you will be
    warned of this and asked if you want to continue and save the table or input some
    non-zero factors. 
    <br />
    Also the old limit on 54 individual factors per factor table has been removed. You
    can now have an unlimited number of factors per factor table as required. 
    <div class="info">
		    <p>The <i>System Administrator</i> will need to use the <i>Menu Maintenance</i> program
		    to manually add this option to the <i>Pension Master File Maintenance</i> menu and
		    then use <i>User File Maintenance</i> to grant permissions to all suitable users so
		    that they can use this new module.</p>
    </div>
</li>
<li>
    <i>Formula File Maintenance</i> has been re-written so as to remove the limit of 100
    lines per formula. You can now have an unlimited number of lines per formula. We also
    added support for the <i>F1</i> and <i>F2</i> keys to insert and delete lines in the
    formulae respectively. When these keys are used, all subsequent lines of the formula
    referring to other lines (in the <i>@line_number</i> notation) are renumbered accordingly. 
</li>
<li>
    <i>Formula File Maintenance</i> now has one screen which scrolls round to allow you
    to edit the formula lines. This is in place of the five separate screens in the old <i>Formula
    File Maintenance</i>. 
</li>
<li>
    As part of the conversion of the quotes over to the new format, a new database table <i>pe_mquote</i> has
    been introduced to hold details of the current and previous quotation values. This
    has necessitated the removing of these fields from the member file. The fieldnames
    are automatically converted by the Pension Master installation program for all your <i>Member
    Reports</i>, <i>Full Member Reports</i> and <i>Mail-Merge Integration Reports</i> as
    follows:

</li>
<li>
    <p>Added support for calls to the new <i>pe_mquote</i> table to <i>Formula File Maintenance</i>.
    These are to be made in the format #field_name(type,index) e.g.</p>
<p>#pmq_current(NORM,1)</p>
    <p>
	If the quote is not found, the function call returns a value of zero and prints an
	appropriate error message to the quotation error log. 
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    Added new report - <i>Renewal Data Report</i> to <i>Pension Master</i>. This can be
    used to produce blank schedules for sending to employers when requesting renewal data.
    The data is sorted by company and then by surname and forename, with each company
    starting on a fresh page. Details pre printed on the report are: 
    <ul>
	<li>
	    Scheme code and name 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Company code and name 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Member number 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Member name 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Date of birth 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Sex 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Marital status 
	</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
	The report automatically prints boxes around each line of member details so as to
	aid the employer in filling in the schedule by hand. 
	<br />
	The administrator can then define titles for up to 5 items of data that they are requesting
	from the employer which are in turn printed on the report. The renewal date used for
	the report is automatically determined by reference to the renewal day and month on <i>Scheme
	File Maintenance</i> and the current year. 
    </p>
    <div class="info">
		    <p>The <i>System Administrator</i> will need to use the <i>Menu Maintenance</i> program
		    to manually add this option to the <i>Pension Master Report</i> menu and then use <i>User
		    File Maintenance</i> to grant permissions to all suitable users so that they can use
		    this new report.</p>
    </div>
</li>
<li>
    Tidied up the report for <i>Diary File Maintenance</i> so that it is much clearer
    and now prints out in landscape rather than the old cluttered portrait printing. 
</li>
<li>
    In the <i>Member Report</i>, <i>Full Members Listing</i> and <i>Mail-Merge Integration
    Report</i>, when you use the <i>Choose</i> menu option, the report selection screen
    now pops up after you enter the selection criteria for your report rather than before
    this. The report selection criteria defaults to selecting only those reports for the
    scheme implied by your selection criteria, but can be overridden to display all report
    if required by blanking off the scheme field. 
</li>
<li>
    The <i>Select</i> menu option in the report selection screen has also been removed
    as this was duplicating exactly the <i>Query</i> option on the same screen. 
</li>
<li>
    Amended <i>Diary File Maintenance</i> so that when you press <i>Return</i> in the <i>Memo</i> field,
    the record stays on the screen rather than automatically saving the details. 
</li>
<li>
    <div class="info">
		    <p>Users should also be aware that the <i>Memo</i> field automatically wordwraps each
		    line of details entered onto the next line when it comes to the end of the existing
		    line - there is no need to press <i>Return</i> at the end of each line to get onto
		    the next line.</p>
    </div>
</li>
<li>
    All <i>F8</i> lookups have been extended to display a maximum of 500 records rather
    than the 200 they used to display. 
</li>
<li>
    A small number of screen display problems when using the <i>F8</i> key and subsequentally
    pressing the <i>Del</i> key in the <i>Scheme Code</i>, <i>Company Code</i>, <i>Category
    Code</i> and <i>Status Code</i> fields in <i>Member File Maintenance</i> have been
    fixed. 
</li>
<li>
    The <i>F8</i> lookups have also been ameneded to show all companies and categories
    for the current scheme when in the <i>Company Code</i> or <i>Category Code</i> fields
    respecively. 
</li>
<li>
    Added <i>Date Of Birth</i> to the available selection criteria in the <i>Member Report</i>, <i>Full
    Members Listing</i> and <i>Mail-Merge Integration Report</i>. This can be used, for
    example, to get a report of everyone over or under a certain age. 
</li>
<li>
    Fixed bug in <i>Member File Maintenance</i> when doing a <i>Transfer</i> in the <i>Switches/Transfer</i> screen.
    All proceeds were having units rounded to two decimal places rather than the correct
    four decimal places. 
</li>
<li>
    Added extra field <i>pm_postcode</i> to <i>Member File Maintenance</i>. This has been
    added to the <i>Address Screen</i> and the field is available for use in the <i>Member
    Report</i>, <i>Full Member Listing</i> and <i>Mail-Merge Integration Report</i>. 
</li>
<li>
    Changed the length of each formula line in <i>Formula File Maintenance</i> to 50 from
    the old 32 characters. This is more in keeping with the new design of the <i>Formula
    File Maintenance</i> program. 
</li>
<li>
    Updated the <i>Calculate Pensionable Salaries</i> program so that you can choose any
    combination of <i>Scheme</i>, <i>Company</i> and <i>Category</i> for the calculations
    with appropriate <i>F8</i> lookups. 
</li>
<li>
    Added a <i>Letter/Cert</i> option to the <i>Company File Maintenance</i> main menu.
    This allows you to produce mail-merge data suitable for import into any word-processor
    for letters to groups of companies or specific companies on <i>Pension Master</i>.
    The fields that are output are as follows: 
    <ul>
	<li>
	    Company Name 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Contact Title 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Contact Firstname 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Contact Surname 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Address Line 1 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Address Line 2 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Address Line 3 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Address Line 4 
	</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>
    For non contracted-out schemes, the <i>Date Contracted Out</i> field on the first
    screen in <i>Member File Maintenance</i> now displays as <i>Qualifying Service Date</i> and
    is to be used for Irish schemes where the Revenue allows service from date joining
    life assurance only part of a scheme, which may well be before <i>Date Joined Scheme</i>.
    The <i>pen_act()</i> and <i>pen_act_proj()</i> functions in <i>Formula File Maintenance</i> have
    been changed accordingly. 
</li>
<li>
    <b>This field will need to be populated for all relevant Irish schemes in order that
    the Pensions Act functions will work correctly.</b> 
</li>
<li>
    Updated <i>Delete A Scheme</i> program to take account of the new database tables
    introduced in this release of <i>Pension Master</i>. 
</li>
<li>
    Amended <i>Category File Maintenance</i> program to take account of the new <i>Quotation
    Type</i> feature implemented in this release of <i>Pension Master</i>. This has necessitated
    replacing all screens in <i>Category File Maintenance</i> apart from the first screen
    with a new <i>Formula Definitions</i> screen. 
    <p>
	We have also introduced a new menu item - <i>Type</i>. This is only available on screen
	2 of <i>Category File Maintenance</i> and has the following sub-options: 
    </p>
    <ul>
	<li>
	    <b>Add</b> - adds a new quotation type. 
	</li>
	<li>
	    <b>Update</b> - updates an existing quotation type. 
	</li>
	<li>
	    <b>Delete</b> - deletes an existing quotation type. 
	</li>
	<li>
	    <b>Next</b> - displays the next quotation type for the current category. 
	</li>
	<li>
	    <b>Previous</b> - displays the previous quotation type for the current category. 
	</li>
	<li>
	    <b>Exit</b> - returns you to the <i>Category File Maintenance</i> main menu. 
	</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
	It is intended that you can set up as many <i>Quotation Types</i> as you wish, grouping
	similar calculation types together e.g. you could set up a <i>Quotation Type</i> of <i>REFUND</i> which
	contained all the calculations relating to a refund of contributions. 
	<br />
	The <i>Category File</i> allows for an unlimited number of <i>Quotation Types</i>,
	with an unlimited number of formulae attached to each <i>Quotation Type</i>. This
	replaces the old maximum of 60 different quotations spread across 4 different <i>Quotation
	Types</i>. 
	<br />
	The old <i>Quotation Types</i> have been converted to the new format as follows, with
	the formula codes you set up under each of them preserved as they were before: 
    </p>
    <ul>
	<li>
	    NORM - Normal Retirement Benefits 
	</li>
	<li>
	    EARLY - Early Retirement Benefits 
	</li>
	<li>
	    DEFER - Deferred &amp; Refund Benefits 
	</li>
	<li>
	    MISC - Miscellaneous Quotes 
	</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
	If you are entering formula codes for a <i>Quotation Type</i>, you can press <i>F8</i> in
	the <i>Formula Code</i> field to get a pop-up picklist of the available formulae for
	the current scheme. Upon selecting a valid <i>Formula Code</i>, the <i>Formula Description</i> defaults
	to whatever you gave for a description of the formula in <i>Formula File Maintenance</i> (if
	you have not already added a suitable <i>Formula Decription</i> in the appropriate
	field on <i>Category File Maintenance</i>). 
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    Added <i>Action Codes Maintenance</i> program to <i>Pension Master</i>. This is to
    be used by the <i>Administration Controller</i> to maintain a set of <i>Action Codes</i>, <i>Action
    Descriptions</i> and <i>Action Timescales</i> for the system. These can then be used
    within the <i>Workflow Maintenance</i> program to set up various <i>Workflow Types</i> e.g.
    you could define a <i>Workflow Type</i> for a refund of contributions, and then define
    each sub-action that is associated with this, like sending out a letter with a cheque
    to the member informing them of the refund amount. 
</li>
<li>
    Against each action you can define a timescale (in number of days) by which the action
    is intended to be completed. This will be used to post items to a members diary for
    each action in the <i>Workflow Type</i> concerned. e.g. in the above example, if you
    set the letter to the member action up as having a timescale of 4 days, then an appropriate
    note will be posted to the current users diary for 4 days from the day the action
    was initiated.

<li>
    Added <i>Workflow Management</i> program to <i>Pension Master</i>. This is to be used
    by the <i>Administration Controller</i> to maintain sets of <i>Workflow Types</i> beneath

    that the <i>Administrator</i> must go through to complete that particular task and
    the associated timescales for each as set up by the <i>Adminbistration Controller</i> in

    showing details of current and outstanding diary items for users of <i>Pension Master</i> which
    have been generated by use of the <i>Workflow Management</i> modules in <i>Pension
    Master</i>. The program allows you to select either a particular user or all users
    on <i>Pension Master</i> for the report output.

    <div class="info">

<li>
    Amended <i>Member File Maintenance</i> to allow for the new <i>Workflow Management</i> features
    in this release of <i>Pension Master</i>. Each time you change a members <i>Status
    Code</i>, a pop-up window appears as in the last release of <i>Pension Master</i> asking
    you for an <i>Effective Date Of Change</i>, which in turn is used to create an entry
    on that members <i>Status History</i> record. 
</li>
<li>
    A new pop-up window is then displayed asking for the <i>Workflow Code</i> to associate
    with this change in <i>Status Code</i>. An <i>F8</i> lookup is available if you are
    unsure of the valid <i>Workflow Codes</i> set up on <i>Pension Master</i>. This is
    in turn used to generate diary reminders for you for each of the <i>Actions</i> associated
    with the selected <i>Workflow Code</i>. These may be viewed by looking at the <i>Action
    Diary</i> screen in <i>Member File Maintenance</i> for the currently selected member. 
    <br />
    If you do not wish to associate a <i>Workflow Code</i> with the change in <i>Status
    Code</i>, simply leave the <i>Workflow Code</i> field blank. 
</li>
<li>
    Amended <i>Member File Maintenance</i> to take account of the new <i>Quotation Type</i> feature
    in this release of <i>Pension Master</i>. The old <i>Quotes Screen 1</i>, <i>Quotes
    Screen 2</i>, <i>Quotes Screen 3</i> and <i>Quotes Screen 4</i> have been replaced
    by a single <i>Quotation Screens</i> screen. When you enter this screen you are presented
    with a pop-up menu asking which <i>Quotation Type</i> you wish to view/update. 
</li>
<li>
    The <i>Formula Descriptions</i> you have set up in <i>Category File Maintenance</i> are
    then displayed to the screen along with both the current and previous quotation values
    for the selected member. 
    <br />
    We have also introduced a new menu item - <i>Type</i>. This is only available on the <i>Quotation
    Screens</i> screen of <i>Member File Maintenance</i> and when selected, displays a
    pop-up menu asking you which <i>Quotation Type</i> you wish to view/update. 
    <br />
    If you select the <i>Update</i> menu option, a pop-up window is displayed inviting
    you to enter any additional information that you may require in your quotes e.g. <i>Final
    Pay For Pension</i>. This is an enhancement of the same feature that used to be only
    available on the <i>Quotes Screen 2</i> and <i>Quotes Screen 3</i> screens in <i>Member
    File Maintenance</i>. 
    <br />
    <b>If there are more than 10 different quotes in the current <i>Quotation Type</i>,
    the screen allows you to scroll the display to view the other quotes in a similar
    way to the <i>Salary History</i> screen in <i>Member File Maintenance</i>.</b> 
</li>
<li>
    Amended <i>Batch Quotation Run</i> to take account of the new <i>Quotation Type</i> feature
    in this release of <i>Pension Master</i>. This has meant moving the <i>Update Type</i> field
    down the screen so as it is after the <i>Scheme</i> field. The <i>Update Type</i> field
    now displays a pop-up menu asking which <i>Quotation Type</i> you wish to run a batch
    of quotations for. This pop-up menu will include all possible <i>Quotation Types</i> for
    the currently selected group of members. Any members selected, who do not have this <i>Quotation
    Type</i> since they are in another <i>Category</i> will have a value of zero returned
    from the calculations. 
</li>
<li>
    <p>Added a new function <i>write(field,@line_num)</i> to <i>Formula File Maintenance</i> as
    follows:</p>

<p><b>write(field,@line_num)</b></p><p><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>

<p>Use this to write back the result of a formula to either the deferred
    pensioners file (pe_dpen) or the pensioners file (pe_pen). This could be useful
    when doing some final calculations for a member and you wish to formally record
    the results of the calculations in either the deferred pensioner or pensioner
    screens in Member File Maintenance.</p>

<p><b>SYNTAX</b></p><p>write(field,@line_num)</p><p><b>EXPLANATION</b></p>

<p>field - a valid numeric field on either the deferred pensioner table (pe_dpen) or the pensioner table (pe_pen). This denotes the field that you wish to write the result of this formula to.</p>
<p>@line_num - the line number of the line you wish to output the result from e.g. if you wish to write the result of line 5 to the field pp_precom_pen in the pensioner table, enter: write(pp_precom_pen,@5)</p>
<p><b>NOTES</b></p>
<ol>
<li>If there already exists a value in the field specified for the member, it will be automatically overwritten with the result of the formula.</li>
<li>You can only reference line numbers before the current formula line i.e. if your write() function is on line 6 of your formula, you cannot reference lines &gt;= line 6 in your write() function call.</li>
For example: write(pp_precom_pen,@10) or write(pdp_grpen_nrd,@2)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
    Removed the link between <i>Category Code</i> and <i>Company Code</i> so that <i>Categories</i> are
    now only sepefic to particular <i>Schemes</i> and not particular <i>Companies</i> within
    particular <i>Schemes</i>. This has greatly reduced the number of <i>Categories</i> necessary
    on <i>Pension Master</i> which in turn will simplify the adding of things like new <i>Formula
    Codes</i> to <i>Categories</i>. 
</li>
<li>
    <p>Calls to the <i>goto</i> function in <i>Formula File Maintenance</i> must now be in
    the format:</p>
<p>goto @line_number</p>
    <p>
	i.e. an '@' symbol is required before the line number. 
	<br />
	<b>The installation program for version 5.01 of <i>Pension Master</i> will automatically
	convert all relevant lines of your formulae over to this new format.</b> 
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    Fixed bug in <i>Unit Possting</i> report where new entrants opening unit balances
    were not being correctly printed on the report. 
</li>
<li>
    Added <i>F8</i> lookup facility to the <i>Query</i> option in the new <i>Factor Table
    Maintenance</i> program. 
</li>
<li>
    When printing columns in the <i>Member Report</i> and <i>Full Members Listing</i> that
    involve different investment funds, the name of the investment fund is now printed
    in the column heading. 
</li>
<li>
    When printing columns in the <i>Member Report</i> and <i>Full Members Listing</i> that
    involve quotation fields, the headings are now printed as "CURRENT QUOTE 1", "CURRENT
    QUOTE 2" etc etc, with a detailed key of what this means printed at the end of the
    report. 
</li>
<li>
    Fixed request number 1, Joan Whelan's note of 19/3/97. 
</li>
<li>
    Fixed request number 3, Joan Whelan's note of 19/3/97. The only time the system now
    jumps straight into browse mode if immediately after running a quotation in the <i>Quotation
    Screen</i> of <i>Member File Maintenance</i>. 
</li>
<li>
    Fixed request number 4, Joan Whelan's note of 19/3/97. 
</li>
<li>
    Fixed request number 5, Joan Whelan's note of 19/3/97. This feature has also been
    amended in the <i>Quotation Screens</i> of the <i>Member File Maintenance</i> module. 
</li>
<li>
    Fixed request number 6, Joan Whelan's note of 19/3/97. 
</li>
<li>
    Added <i>Salary Listing Report</i> as per request number 8, Joan Whelan's note of
    19/3/97. This allows you to print off salary details for a selected group of members,
    for a specified salary date. This can then be used, for example, as part of the post
    year end renewal process. 
</li>
<li>
    Also applied this request to <i>Member File Maintenance</i> and <i>Scheme File Maintenance</i> modules
    as similar behaviour was being exhibited there. 
</li>
<li>
    Fixed request number 9, Joan Whelan's note of 19/3/97. Also applied this request to <i>Member
    File Maintenance</i> and <i>Scheme File Maintenance</i> modules as similar behaviour
    was being exhibited there. 
</li>
<li>
    Fixed request number 10, Joan Whelan's note of 19/3/97. 
</li>
<li>
    In <i>Batch Data Input</i>, do not allow the user to amend contributions, salary details
    or NI History details if the <i>Batch Posted</i> flag is set to <i>Y</i>. Instead,
    encourage the user to amend the batch date to a new date and them update the rest
    of the batch details as required. 
</li>
<li>
    In <i>Batch Data Input</i>, contributions are now allocated to investment funds 1-20
    after the user has pressed <i>Esc</i> to save the current screen of batch contribution
    details, rather than dynamically allocating them to funds 1-20 as and when each line
    of member details are input. This avoids the problem of re-using an old batch where
    some members have changed their <i>Investment Choice</i> allocation details since
    the old batch was last used. All old batches should now function correctly, with the
    contributions being allocated as per the current <i>Member Investment Choice</i> instructions
    for each member. 
</li>
<li>
    Extra validation has been added to the <i>Sex</i> and <i>Title</i> fields on the <i>Basic
    Member Details</i> screen of <i>Member File Maintenance</i> so that, for example,
    a user cannot enter a member as male with a title of Mrs or a female with a title
    of Miss with a marital status of MA. 
</li>
<li>
    Added a pop-up window in the <i>Basic Member Details</i> screen of <i>Member File
    Maintenance</i> to accept input of <i>Title</i>, <i>Forename</i> and <i>Surname</i> so
    as to make it clearer to the user what is required in each field. Previously the user
    had to rely on being familiar with <i>Pension Master</i> to know what was expected
    where in these fields. 
</li>
<li>
    Changed the validation of the <i>Date Of Birth</i> field on the <i>Basic Member Details</i> screen
    of <i>Member File Maintenance</i> so that it no longer insists that the member is
    aged between 16 and 75. Instead, the user is warned if the member falls outside this
    age range and is asked if they really mean the date of birth to be what they input
    or do they want to input a different date of birth. This is to allow for the case
    of a young child or an elderly dependent entering the scheme. 
</li>
<li>
    Fixed small bug in <i>Member Investment Choice</i> sscreen of <i>Member File Maintenance</i> that
    allowed you to enter values that totalled to greater than 100% for each conbtribution
    source. The module now checks each contribution source total to ensure that it is
    either 0% or 100%. 
</li>
<li>
    Added an optional facility to <i>Batch Data Input</i> to allow <i>Pension Master</i> to
    automatically generate a list of member numbers and display these to the screen when
    adding a new batch. This is designed to save time with having to input the member
    numbers manually for each batch entry. 
</li>
<li>
    This is done via a pop-up window when adding a batch and immediately before the user
    is allowed to enter any details in the second screen of the module. The pop-up window
    allows you to order the member numbers displayed as follows: 
    <ul>
	<li>
	    A - Member Number 
	</li>
	<li>
	    B - Surname, Forename 
	</li>
	<li>
	    C - Employer Reference 
	</li>
	<li>
	    D - Date Of Birth 
	</li>
	<li>
	    ' ' - Do Not Produce List Of Member Numbers 
	</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="info">
		    <p>If you select options A, B, C or D, the member numbers generated only relate to
		    active members on <i>Pension Master</i> and will not include any members with a <i>Status
		    Code</i> that has an associated <i>Status Type</i> not equal to 'A' i.e. non-active
		    members.</p> 
		    <p>It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that all members that should be
			included in the batch are present.</p>
    </div>
</li>
<li>
    Updated <i>Pension Master</i> with the Section 148 Revaluation Orders and CEP/CA Factors
    for the tax year 1997/98 (UK Only) as part of the installation process for this version
    of <i>Pension Master</i>. 
</li>
<li>
    Introduced a new menu <i>Annual Renewals</i> to the <i>Pension Master Main Menu</i>.
    This contains the following options: 
    <ul>
	<li>
	    1 - Renewal Data Request 
	</li>
	<li>
	    2 - Batch Data Input 
	</li>
	<li>
	    3 - Salary Listing Report 
	</li>
	<li>
	    4 - Contributions Report 
	</li>
	<li>
	    5 - Investment Value Summary Run 
	</li>
	<li>
	    6 - Batch Quotation Run 
	</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="info">
		    <p>The <i>System Administrator</i> will need to use the <i>Menu Maintenance</i> program
		    to manually add this option to the <i>Pension Master File Maintenance</i> menu and
		    then use <i>User File Maintenance</i> to grant permissions to all suitable users so
		    that they can use this new module.</p>
    </div>
</li>
<li>
    Introduced a new menu <i>System Data</i> to the <i>Pension Master Main Menu</i>. This
    contains the following options: 
    <ul>
	<li>
	    1 - Special Codes Maintenance 
	</li>
	<li>
	    2 - Section 148 Order Maintenance

	<li>
	    3 - CEP Factor Maintenance

    </div>
</li>
<li>
    Added a new module <i>Investment Value Summary Run</i> to <i>Pension Master</i>. This
    allows you to calculate for each selected member, the current value of their unit
    holdings, based on either a bid or an offer price and write the results back to the <i>Investment
    Value Summary</i> screen in <i>Member File Maintenance</i> for each selected member.
    The module also prints off a report detailing the calculations made for each member.
    This can be an easy and useful summary of the current value of the funds assets. The
    results of the <i>Investment Value Summary</i> screen are now stored in a new database
    table pe_fval. 
</li>
<li>
    <p>The format of the new table is as follows:</p>
<table cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Format</th>

<tr>
<td>pfv_member</td>
<td>Member Number</td>
<td>INTEGER</td>

    <p>
	These fields are all available in the <i>Member Report</i>, <i>Full Members Listing</i> and <i>Mail-Merge
	Integration Report</i> in the normal way. These reports expect the relevant field
	to be called with an argument to denote the investment fund required e.g. pfv_eeord(1)
	gets the current value of <i>Employee Ordinary Units</i> for <i>Investment Fund</i> 1. 
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    Added a new module <i>Special Codes Maintenance</i> to <i>Pension Master</i>. This
    allows the <i>System Administrator</i> to set up and maintain a set of <i>Special
    Codes</i> which can subsequently be used in the new <i>Special Codes</i> screen of <i>Member
    File Maintenance</i>. These special codes can be used to assign a particular feature
    e.g. AVC's pre 1987 to a group of members. These can then be used within the <i>Member
    Report</i>, <i>Full Members Listing</i> or <i>Mail-Merge Integration Report</i> to
    report on only those members with the selected <i>Special Code</i>. This has been
    added mainly to maintain backward compatibility with certain other pension administration
    software vendors legacy systems. 
</li>
<li>
    Added a new <i>Special Codes</i> screen to <i>Member File Maintenance</i> which holds
    details of all the <i>Special Codes</i> relating to the current member. These can
    be used as described in the previous paragraph. You can also add and delete <i>Special
    Codes</i> for the current meember through this screen. Appropraie <i>F8</i> lookup
    facilities are available to list the <i>Special Codes</i> that have been set up on
    your system by your <i>System Administrator</i>. 
</li>
<li>
    Added <i>Special Codes</i> field to the list of available selection criteria in the <i>Member
    Report</i>, <i>Full Members Listing</i> and <i>Mail-Merge Integration</i> report.
    An <i>F8</i> lookup facility is provided on this field so as you can get a list of
    the <i>Special Codes</i> that have been set up on your system by your <i>System Administrator</i>.
    Leave this field blank to select members, regardless of the <i>Special Codes</i> that
    may be allocated to them, or input a valid <i>Special Code</i> to report on only those
    members with the specified <i>Special Code</i>. 
</li>
<li>
    Fixed bug in <i>Update/Correct History Program</i> that did not allow the user to
    correctly select member records for updating. 
</li>
<li>
    Amended <i>Contribution History</i> screen in <i>Member File Maintenance</i> so that
    all contribution entries can be up to 9999999.99 and expenses figures up to 999999.99.
    This fixes a previous problem where large contributions and expenses were displaying
    to the screen as a line of ********'s. 
</li>
<li>
    Amended <i>Renewal Data Request Report</i> report so that the renewal date always
    defaults to the next renewal date after today's date e.g. for Jan/Feb renewals which
    are produced in the previous Nov/Dec, the renewal date will now be correctly shown.
    This fixes the last part of point 7 of Joan Whelan's note of 19/3/97. 
</li>
<li>
    Amended <i>Renewal Data Request Report</i> so that it now prints two lines per member
    record, allowing the user to ask for up to 10 data items on the one report. The report
    also prints off <i>Employers Reference Code</i> (pm_pay_num) so as to aid the client
    when filling out the report. 
</li>
<li>
    Fixed bug when inserting lines in <i>Formula File Maintenancxe</i> when the lines
    you are inserting are off the bottom of the screen - reference bug found by NJ on
    16/5/97. 
</li>
<li>
    Fixed bug with inserting/deleting lines in <i>Formula File Maintenance</i> when @line
    references were only being incremented for lines subsequent to the current line. This
    refers to the bug reported in JW's fax of 15/5/97. 
</li>
<li>
    Fixed bug in <i>Formula File Maintenance</i> line syntax checker which was only allowing
    a maximum line length of 34 characters rather than the new 50 characters. Reference
    JW's fax of 20/5/97.
