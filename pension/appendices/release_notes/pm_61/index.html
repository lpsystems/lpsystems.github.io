        </div>
        

      <h2>Important Notes In Relation To The Euro
</h2>
<ol>
<li>
    You will need to amend Scheme User Defined Screen, User Defined Field and User Defiled
    Array field formats from N2 to MO (see here for
    further details on how to do this) if you wish these amounts to be converted by any
    of the new Pension Master Euro functionality. All user defined field types of type
    Nx (where x = 1,...,6) will not be converted to Euro's as they are assumed to be non-numeric
    values. 
</li>
<li>
    All quotation results will be assumed to be monetary amounts for the purposes of any
    Euro conversions and will thus be converted to Euro's as and when the scheme base
    currency is changed to ther Euro. If the results of any quotations are not monetary
    amounts you will need to re-run the quotations in order to obtain valid non-monetary
    amounts. 
</li>
<li>
    Any monetary amounts referred to in either Scheme Notes or Member Notes will not be
    converted to Euro's as there is no way for Pension Master to distinguish between monetary
    amounts and other numeric items in the notes. All users of Pension Master should be
    made aware of this. 
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Other Important Issues To Note For This Release
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    <b>GUI Unix Version only</b>. Due to the introduction of formal username and password
    facilities directly in Pension Master, it will be necessary to change the command
    line used by the Pension Master icon on each PC that requires access to Pension Master.
    The following is the command line required and assumes that your Pension Mater server
    hostname is <i>saturn, </i>the user is called <i>john </i>and that the Pension Master
    client software is installed in <i>c:\penmast </i>on the PC. Substitute your own values
    here as required. It should be entered into the <i>Target</i> field on the <i>Shortcut</i> tab
    of your Pension Master icon: 
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<table cols="1" width="95%" border="1">
    <tbody>
	<tr>
	    <td>
		c:\penmast\bin\startwtk.exe ilogin -w -computer {saturn} -user {john} -term {xterm}
		<br />
		-cmd "COMSPEC=@ENV{COMSPEC};export COMSPEC;FGLSERVER=@IP:0;
		<br />
		export FGLSERVER;FGLGUI=1;export FGLGUI;fglrun gn_logon;exit"</td>
	</tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
    Various new menu options are added to Pension Master by this release. These are noted
    in more detail in the points that follow. You should make sure these new menu options
    are switched on for all users that require access to them by assigning the correct
    privelages using User File Maintenance.
    We would suggest that the easiest way to do this is to use the new Default option
    in User File Maintenance which is documented in more detail here.
    You should then use the System Administrator, Supervisor and Assign
    Users To Schemes options to control which users have the privelages necessary
    to use certain programs. Further details of how these options affect the options available
    to the user are to be found here. 
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Formula File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>

<h2>Formula File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
Extended the avg() and avgmax() functions in the formula file to allow a fifth averaging
basis of dynamisation. The relevant help text is as follows: 
</p>
<p>
<b> 
    avg(field,n,fld1,fld2)</b>
</p> 
<p>
    <b>OVERVIEW</b> 
</p>
<p>
    Use the avg function to calculate the average of a history field over a particular
    number of years. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>SYNTAX</b> 
</p>
<p>
    avg(field,n,fld1,fld2) 
</p>
<p>
    <b>EXPLANATION</b> 
</p>
<p>
    field -  is a field on the salary history or contribution history files (pe_defsal or pe_defhst_b respectively).
</p>
<p>
    n - is the number of years to average the history field over. 
</p>
<p>
    fld1 - is the effective start conditions of the averaging.
</p>
<p>
    fld2 - is the basis of the averaging. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>NOTES</b> 
</p>
<ol>
    <li>If n = 0, the function will return a value of 0.</li>
    <li>n can take any value less than 40. i.e you can average the history field over no more than 40 years.</li>
    <li>fld1 can take the alphabetic values 'e' and 'l'.
<ul>
<li>
'e' - will commence the averaging period from Calculation Date.
</li>
<li>
'l' - will commence the averaging period from Calculation Date but will ignore the latest entry.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>fld2 can take the values 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.</li>
<ol>
<li>
will average extracted amounts using the highest amount if there is more than one in the same calendar year.
</li>
<li>
will average extracted amounts using the first amount if there is more than one in the same calendar year. 
</li>
<li>
will average extracted amounts recorded at the renewal dd/mm as recorded on Scheme File Maintenance. A warning will be generated if there are missing years in the salary history. 
</li>
<li>
will average extracted amounts using the period the amount was effective for.
</li>
<li>
will average extracted amounts recorded at the renewal dd/mm as recorded on Scheme File Maintenance and dynamise using the appropriate RPI values. N.B. The correct calculation of an average salary using this basis is dependant on the relevant RPI values being present in MLI/RPI File Maintenance. A warning will be generated if there are missing years in the salary history.
</li>

</ol>

    <b>avgmax(fld,n1,n2,fld1,fld2)</b> 
</p>
<p>
    <b>OVERVIEW</b> 
</p>
<p>
    Use the avgmax function to calculate the best band of consecutive years history over
    a given period. 
    <br />
    e.g. to calculate the best three year average gross salary over the last ten years. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>SYNTAX</b> 
</p>
<p>
    avgmax(field,n1,n2,fld1,fld2) 
</p>
<p>
    <b>EXPLANATION</b> 
</p>
<p>
    field - is a field on the salary history or contribution history files (pe_defsal or pe_defhst_b respectively). 
</p>
<p>
    n1 - is the number of years to find the best consecutive n2 years average over. 
</p>
<p>
    n2 - is the number of consecutive years to average the history field over. 
</p>
<p>
    fld1 - is the effective start conditions of the averaging. 
</p>
<p>
    fld2 - is the basis of the averaging. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>NOTES</b> 
</p>
<ol>
    <li>If n1 = 0 or n2 = 0, the function will return a value of 0.</li>
    <li>n1 can take any value less than 40. i.e you can average the history field over no more than 40 years.</li>
    <li>If n2 &gt; number of years history for a particular member then the function performs the average over the number of years history data available. e.g. if you try to use 
    avgmax(pds_grsal,10,3,e,1) and there is only 2 years gross salary details for a 
    particular member, the function will look at consecutive two year averages of gross 
    salary to arrive at the result.</li>
    <li>fld1 can take the alphabetic values 'e' and 'l'.
    <ul>
	<li>
    'e' - will commence the averaging period from Calculation Date.
	</li>

<h2>Transfer In
</h2>
<p>
The members Transfer In screen has been changed from a one screen format to three
screens. 
</p>
<p>
Upon entry to the screen any existing transfers for the current member are displayed
in a window. A specific transfer can then be selected and the transfer details displayed
on the screen. The menu has been changed slightly so that the second and third screens
of details can be seen by pressing the "2" or "3" keys or by moving the highlight
bar with the arrow keys and pressing <kbd>Return</kbd>. In a similar way the first screen
of details can be seen by pressing the "1" key or by using the arrow keys. 
</p>
<p>
The Add option is only available from the first screen. This allows the user to enter
the first screens data then automatically switch to the second and then third screens.
Upon clicking on 'Ok' on the second screen the data from <b>both</b> the screens is
saved to the file. Also if you click on 'Cancel' on the second screen data that was
previously entered on the first screen will <b>not</b> be saved. 
</p>
<p>
Browsing of a members Transfer In details can be performed on either screen, the same
also applies to any Updating required. 
</p>
<h2>Uniplex
</h2>
<p>
Dropped support for the old Uniplex office application as it is no longer used by
any of our clients and there is no prospect of any further clients using it. 
</p>
<h2>Batch Data Input
</h2>
<p>
Extended Query criteria to allow users to search on Batch Number, Scheme Code, Company
Code, Category Code, Status Code and Batch Date. 
</p>
<h2>Transfer Out
</h2>
<p>
The format of the members Transfer Out screen has been changed. 
</p>
<p>
Upon entry to the screen any existing transfers for the current member are displayed
in a window. A specific transfer can then be selected and the transfer details displayed
on the screen. 
</p>
<h2>Pending Transfers Out Report
</h2>
<p>
A new report used in conjunction with the new Transfer Out screen to be found on the
Standard Reports sub-menu. This report lists any members who have had a transfer out
date agreed but the transfer out has not been paid. 
</p>
<div class="info">
	    <p>System Administrators: You will need to make this extra menu option available to
	    users as appropriate by granting access using the User File Maintenance module of
	    Pension Master. By default all new menus and menu option added to Pension Master
	    will not be switched on for any users.</p>
</div>
<h2>Member File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
The layout of the Additional Benefits screen has been amended. 
</p>
<p>
The field 'Additional Benefit Number' has been dropped and the 'Benefit Code' has
been moved to be the lead data item for this screen. 'Spouses Before Retirement' and
'Spouses After Retirement' fields have been extended to be a two decimal place entry
to allow non integer values. 
</p>
<h2>Code Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
The Additional Benefit Code option on the System Data menu has been replaced by the Codes
Maintenance option. This new option allows five different types of Code to be
entered through the same screen as follows: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    A - Additional Benefit Codes 
</li>
<li>
    D - Deferred Pensioner Codes 
</li>
<li>
    I - Transfer In Codes 
</li>
<li>
    O - Transfer Out Codes 
</li>
<li>
    P - Pensioner Codes 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These codes are then used when setting up the relevant record on the member file. <b>The
Deferred Pensioner and Pensioner Codes will be used by new screens in the next release
of Pension Master.</b> 
</p>
<h2>Transfer In/Out Data
</h2>
<p>
The file old pe_transfer database table (which used to hold details of both transfer
in's and transfer out's) has been replaced by new separate tables, pe_tvin and pe_tvout.
The installation procedure creates the new files and copies the existing data. Because
the new Transfer In/Out screens rely on individual codes (as set up in Codes
Maintenance) to access the additional data, the program will automatically create
several new codes as follows:
</p>
<p>
Transfer In's TPxxxxxx with a description
of "Transfer Pension" 
<br />
Transfer Out's TCxxxxxx with a description
of "Transfer to a New Company" 
</p>
<p>
The number section of the code will depend entirely on the number of Transfers for
that member. e.g. if the member already has 2 Transfer In's, then the codes will be
named TP000001 and TP000002 respectively.

<h2>Database Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
Added a new module, Database Maintenance to Pension Master. This is available under
the GUI version of Pension Master only and allows you to set up and maintain extra
databases in addition to the default 'pension' database. 
</p>
<p>
This can be useful when, for example, setting up and testing formulae, where you do
not wish the formulae to be available on a live system until they have been properly
de-bugged. See the Database Maintenance section of the
User Manual for further details. 
</p>
<p>
If your Pension Master has multiple databases, you can tell which one you are connected
to by looking at the titlebar of the Pension Master window - it will have a <i>(dbasename.dbs)</i> at
the end of it, where <i>dbasename</i> is the name of the database you are using. 
<br />
</p>
<div class="info">
	    System Administrators: You will need to make this extra menu option available to
	    users as appropriate by granting access using the User File Maintenance module of
	    Pension Master. By default all new menus and menu options added to Pension Master
	    will not be switched on for any users.
</div>
<h2>Logon Screen
</h2>
<p>
This is available for the GUI version of Pension Master only and is to be used as
the first screen that users see when clicking on the Pension Master icon from their
desktops. This allows the user to log into Pension Master by use of the standard username
and password sequence. It also allows users to change their password as and when required. 
</p>
<p>
All passwords are stored in a one-way encryption format making it extremely difficult
to crack passwords and additional controls over the choice of passwords have been
introduced in the System Parameter
Maintenance module of Pension Master. 
</p>
<p>
It is not now possible to run individual Pension Master modules in the GUI environment
without first logging into Pension Master using this login screen, thus further strengthening
the security that is built into Pension Master. 
</p>
<h2>System Parameter Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
Two extra screens have been added to the System Parameter Maintenance module. These
are as follows: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Audit Trail Details - additional
    parameters to control how changes to date are logged to the audit trail. 
</li>
<li>
    Password Option Details - settings
    to control how a user may choose their password using the 'Logon Program' detailed
    above. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Further details are available by following the links above. 
</p>
<h2>Audit Trail Listing
</h2>
<p>
The old Audit Trail Listing program has been replaced by a new revised Audit
Trail Listing program. This now logs much more detail relating to any addition,
update or deletion of data on your Pension Master system. It also allows you to print
off the audit trail in a variety of formats and search for specific changes made to
the database e.g. all changes made by the user 'john' on 9/10/98. 
</p>
<p>
The values of each data item in question are logged to the audit trail both in before
and after change mode, giving you a complete picture of the data changes made to your
system over time. 
</p>
<p>
The way Pension Master logs database changes is now set via a second screen in System
Parameter Maintenance as detailed above. 
</p>
<h2>Euro Compliance
</h2>
<p>
Pension Master has been amended to take full account of the introduction of the Euro
as a currency on 1/1/1999. Full details can be found in Appendix
H - Euro Support In Pension Master in the User Manual. 
</p>
<h2>Member File Maintenance
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    Added a new 'Refund of Contributions' screen. Further details can be found in the Refund
    Of Contributions section of the User Manual. 
</li>
<li>
    Added a new 'Death Details' screen. Further details can be found in the Death
    Details section of the User Manual. 
</li>
<li>
    Added new 'Quick Letter' facility to the GUI version of Pension Master only. Further
    details can be found in the Producing
    Ad-Hoc Letters section of the User Manual. 
</li>
<li>
    Added new 'Quick Search' facility to the GUI version of Pension Master only. Further
    details can be found in the Quick Search section
    of the User Manual. 
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Formula File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
    Added a lookup facility to the entry of factor tables for either actuarial or term
    related factors, available by clicking on the 'Search' button. 
</p>
<p>
    Split up the formula help facility into separate categories of formula functions as
    having all possible formula options in one long list was getting unwieldy. 
</p>
<p>
    Extended the syntax of the defhst() formula funtion to allow you to retrieve contribution
    details for any investment fund rather than being limited to fund 00 as before. All
    your existing formulae references to defhst() will automatically be converted over
    to the new format by the database update program. The manual page for the revised
    function is as follows: 
</p>
<p>
<b>defhst(fld,nn,yyyymmdd)</b> 
</p>
<p>
    <b>OVERVIEW</b> 
</p>
<p>
    Use the defhst function to lookup a specific field on the contribution history file
    (pe_defhst_b) for a specified investment fund for a specified date. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>SYNTAX</b> 
</p>
<p>
    defhst(fld,nn,yyyymmdd) 
</p>
<p>
    <b>EXPLANATION</b> 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
	fld - is a valid field on the contribution history file (pe_defhst_b). 
    </li>
    <li>
	nn - is the investment fund number required. This must be in the range 0 to 20. 
    </li>
    <li>
	yyyymmdd - is the date for which you wish to look up the contribution field. yyyy
	is the year value, mm is the month value and dd is the day value. 
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>

    Added new date manipulation functions as follows: 
</p>
<p>
<b>date_first(date)</b>
</p> 
<p>
    <b>OVERVIEW</b> 
</p>
<p>
    Use the date_first function to calculate the first day of the month in which the date
    implied by the function argument falls. e.g. if date is 10/3/98, the function will
    return 1/3/98.

	<b>OVERVIEW</b> 
    </p>
    <p>
	Use the post_88_gmp_death function to calculate the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP)
	accrued after 6 April 1988, revalued to date of death. 
    </p>
    <p>
	<b>SYNTAX</b> 
    </p>
    <p>
	post_88_gmp_death(p,a) 
    </p>
    <p>
	<b>EXPLANATION</b> 
	<br />
    </p>
    <ul>
	<li>
	    a - is a single character field that takes the value 'Y' or 'N'. It denotes whether
	    to include any transfered-in GMP in the GMP calculations 
	</li>
	<li>
	    p - is a single character field that denotes the type of GMP revaluation as follows: 
	    <ul>
		<li>
		    L - Limited rate revaluation 
		</li>
		<li>
		    F - Fixed rate revaluation 
		</li>
		<li>
		    S - Section 148 orders. These are assumed to be the same as for Fixed Rate revaluation. 
		</li>
	    </ul>
	</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
	<b>NOTES</b> 
	<br />
    </p>
    <ol>
	<li>
	    Date of death is taken from the Date Of Death field on the Death Details screen in
	    the member record. If this is blank, date of death is assumed to be the Date Left
	    field on the Basic Member Details screen. If this is blank, then a warning will be
	    written to the Quotation Warnings Report and this function will return a value of
	    0. 
	</li>
	<li>
	    If date of death is later than State Pension Date then the GMP is revalued up to State
	    Pension Date using Fixed, Limited or Section 148 orders, and between State Pension
	    Date and Normal Retirement Date at 1/7% per week, providing the period between State
	    Pension Date and Normal Pension Date is at least seven weeks. 
	</li>

<h2>Contributions Report &amp; Unit Allocation Report
</h2>
<p>
These reports have been reordered to list selected members in surname order within
investment fund for each scheme. If users wish to generate listings for a specific
company or category, then they will be able to utilise the selection criteria to generate
the report for the specified criteria. 
</p>
<h2>Scheme Level Code Allocation
</h2>
<p>
The Codes Maintenance option has been extended
to allow codes to be allocated to specific Schemes, rather than having system-wide
global codes. 
</p>
<p>
An additional screen has been introduced to the Scheme
File to facilitate this. This screen is used to change the codes that have been
allocated to the Scheme. These codes are used to identify separate Additional
Benefits, Transfer In, Transfer
Out, Deferred
Pensioner and Pensioner details
for members of the Scheme. 
</p>
<p>
When a members additional benefits, transfer in, transfer out, deferred pensioner
or pensioner details are updated a lookup list for the code to use for the particular
record will only show the codes relating to the members Scheme. 
</p>
<p>
When you add a scheme, a standard set group of codes will be automatically created.
Any additional codes that may be required for each scheme must first be entered using
the Codes Maintenance option on the System
Data menu, and then allocated to the scheme using this new screen in Scheme File Maintenance. 
</p>
<h2>Member File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
The Delete option in the Member File has been modified so that instead of deleting
the whole member record regardless of what screen in the member file you are in, the
delete option is more context sensitive. What is deleted by using the Delete option
is dependent on the screen you are in as follows: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Basic Member Details screen - the Delete option deletes all data for the current member,
    including all related member data e.g. salaries and contributions. The whole of the
    member record will be deleted from your Pension Master system. 
</li>
<li>
    Additional Benefits screen - the Delete option deletes the currently selected additional
    benefits record in for the current member. 
</li>
<li>
    Transfer In screen - the Delete option deletes the currently selected transfer in
    record for the current member. 
</li>
<li>
    Transfer Out screen - the Delete option deletes the currently selected transfer out
    record for the current member. 
</li>
<li>
    Refund Of Contributions screen - the Delete option deletes the refund of contributions
    details for the current member. 
</li>
<li>
    Deferred Pensioner screen - the Delete option deletes the deferred pensioner details
    for the current member. 
</li>
<li>
    Pensioner screen - the Delete option deletes the pensioner details for the current
    member. 
</li>
<li>
    Death details screen - the Delete option deletes the death details for the current
    member. 
</li>
<li>
    User Defined Screens - the Delete option deletes the currently selected user defined
    screen values for the current member. 
</li>
<li>
    User Defined Arrays - the Delete option deletes the currently selected user defined
    array values for the current member. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Delete option is only available in the above screens and will not be displayed
on the menu if you are in any other screen as it is not relevant. 
</p>
<p>
Further details can be found in the section Deleting
Member Records elsewhere in this User Manual. 
</p>
<h2>Workgroup Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
Introduced a new Workgroup Maintenance module to Pension Master. This can be found
on the 'System Administration' menu. This allows users to set up workgroups which
can then be used to sub-divide the users on your Pension Master system, for example,
into different administration teams or areas. 
</p>
<p>
Further details can be found in the section Workgroup Maintenance elsewhere
in this User Manual. 
</p>
<div class="info">
	    <p>System Administrators: You will need to make this extra menu option available to
	    users as appropriate by granting access using the User File Maintenance module of
	    Pension Master. By default all new menus and menu options added to Pension Master
	    will not be switched on for any users.</p>
</div>
<h2>Scheme File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
Introduced a new User Access Details screen. This screen shows who has access to this
scheme and the members contained therein. 
</p>
<div class="info">
	    <p>The database upgrade program will automatically assign access to all schemes to
	    all users. If you wish to restrict access to particular schemes on your system,
	    you will need to use the User Access Details screen in Scheme File Maintenance to
	    manually alter the access options for your users.</p>
</div>
<p>
Further details can be found in the section User
Access Details elsewhere in this User Manual. 
</p>
<h2>User File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
Introduced a new User Access Details screen. This screen shows which schemes this
user has access to. Also introduced a Workgroup field on the Basic User Details screen
in User File Maintenance to hold the workgroup (if any) that the user belongs to.
See here for further details. 
</p>
<p>
Further details can be found under User
Access Details in the User File Maintenance section of this User Manual. 
</p>
<h2>Member File Maintenance
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    Replaced the 'Fund' sub-menu in the Contribution History, Expected Contribution History
    and Unit History screens of Member File Maintenance with two new menu options "&lt;
    Fund" and "Fund &gt;". These are set out in more detail here. 
</li>
<li>
    Amended the Investment Value Summary screen
    in Member File Maintenance so that it is easier to read. Previously this screen had
    been very cramped and was not easy to decipher. The screen has been revised so that
    only details pertaining to two investment funds are displayed to the screen at any
    one time. The total value across all investment funds is displayed at the foor of
    the screen. The new "&lt; Fund" and "Fund &gt;" menu options outlined in the previous
    item are available to navigate between the different investment funds. 
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Formula File Maintenance
</h2>
<ol>
<li>
    Removed the old function tot_fxpup() from Pension Master as the fields it refererred
    to (ptv_fx1, ptv_fx2 and ptv_fx3) are no longer part of Pension Master. All references
    to tot_fxpup() in your formulae have will be converted to references to the new tot_transfer_in()
    function by the database upgrade progrsm install.4ge. 
</li>
<li>
    Added an extra argument to the GMP functions to allow the user to specify whether
    transferred-in GMP should be included in the calculation of the GMP. This extra argument
    takes the values 'Y' or 'N'. See Formula File Maintenance in
    the User Manual for further details. Any references to GMP functions in your existing
    formulae will automatically be converted over to the new format by the Pension Master
    database upgrade program that is run by your System Administrator as part of the process
    of upgrading to this version of Pension Master. These will default to not including
    any transferred-in GMP in GMP calculations so as to ensure backward compatability
    with the old GMP functions. <b>Should you wish to include transferred-in GMP in your
    current GMP calculations, you will need to manually change your formulae as appropriate.</b> 
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Formula File Maintenance
</h2>
<ul>
<p>
    Removed the old function transfer(field,type,nn) from Pension Master as this function
    referred to the old pe_transfer file (see section above). 
</p>
<p>
    The following 5 functions have been added to select and manipulate data from the new
    Transfer In and Transfer Out files:
