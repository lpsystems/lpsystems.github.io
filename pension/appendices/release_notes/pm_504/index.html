      <h2>Details Of The Changes
</h2>
<ol>
<li>
    Added new Part Time Service record. This will allow users to record the part time
    hours worked for members. 
    <p>
	The record relies on a complete history being recorded i.e. if the member joined as
	full time, then the record should show the period as full time e.g. 40 hours worked
	out of 40. 
    </p>
    <p>
	When the members hours change then the period should be closed off at the appropriate
	date and a new line opened at the new period start date with the new part time and
	full time hours. 
    </p>
    <p>
	Equivalent service periods are automatically calculated as the user moves from each
	line and total equivalent service is calculated when the input is accepted. 
    </p>
    <p>
	The next system release will allow the user to incorporate this record in formulae
	and reports. This record is being released now to enable users to record part time
	hours details in a proper format prior to the full facility being available. 
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    Changed the way Pension Master calculates expenses when taking expenses off incoming
    contributions. This is no longer done at the Investment Manager level as it was before.
    Instead, a single set of expenses applies across all investment funds within a scheme.
    We have also replaced the Fund % Expense with a Salary % Expense. This allows you
    to take a percentage of salary (you define the salary type you wish to use - Gross,
    Scheme, Pensionable, Miscellaneous 1 or Miscellaneous 2) as an expense. See the User
    Manual for further details. 
</li>
<li>
    Added extra display fields <i>Release Date</i> and <i>Licensed To</i> to the splash
    screen which appears upon starting Pension Master. This should allow L&amp;P Systems
    Limited support staff to more effectively track the versions of Pension Master installed
    at client sites. 
</li>
<li>
    Changed the main menu in the <i>Unit Posting</i> program as follows: 
    <ul>
	<li>
	    Changed the text of the <i>Proceed</i> menu option to <i>Post_units</i>. 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Removed the old uNpost menu option. The Undo menu option now combines the capabilities
	    of the old Undo and uNpost menu options thus removing the confusion some users were
	    having over the difference of these two menu options. The new combined menu option
	    can be used for: 
	    <ul>
		<li>
		    Unposting units for a user specified group of members and a given contribution date. 
		</li>
		<li>
		    Re-setting the unit posted flag on a particular contribution date to "N" for a user
		    specified group of members. 
		</li>
	    </ul>
	</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>
    Changed the <i>Update Conts/Units</i> flag on the <i>Scheme File Maintenance</i> program
    to read <i>Allow Manual Update Of Units?.</i> This flag is now has the following implications: 
    <ul>
	<li>
	    It determines whether a user can update the unit history of a member of the scheme
	    by directly editing units on that members <i>Unit History</i> screen in <i>Member
	    File Maintenance</i>. <b>We would generally recommend that you do not directly edit
	    a members unit history screen other that for manually loading cumulative units to
	    date</b> (for example where you are taking over the administration of a scheme and
	    are setting up a starting point for future unit allocation for the scheme). To adjust
	    a members unit history we would recommend that you use the Undo menu option in the
	    Unit Posting program to reverse the unit allocation for that member and then make
	    any adjustments to the contribution and unit price entries for that date before re-posting
	    that contribution to units. This ensures a proper reconciliation of the whole process
	    within Pension Master and avoids any errors that may have otherwise occurred using
	    manual editing of units. 
	</li>
	<li>
	    It determines how the unit posting flag on new contributions loaded onto Pension Master
	    is set. If the flag on the scheme file is set to "Y", then all new contributions loaded
	    onto Pension Master (whether through <i>Batch File Maintenance</i> or <i>Member File
	    Maintenance</i>) will automatically have a unit posting flag of "Y" allocated to them.
	    Conversely, if the flag on the scheme file is set to "N" then all new contributions
	    will be loaded with a unit posting flag of "N". The exception to this rule is for
	    defined benefits or final salary type schemes (where the <i>Defined Contribution Scheme</i> flag
	    in <i>Scheme File Maintenance</i> is set to "N"). In this case, all new contributions
	    loaded onto Pension Master will automatically have a unit posting flag of "Y". 
	</li>
	<li>
	    <b>We would generally recommend that the <i>Allow Manual Update Of Units?</i> flag
	    is set to "N" for all schemes unless you specifically wish to directly edit a members
	    Unit History.</b> In this case, set the flag on the Scheme File to "Y" whilst you
	    make the edit to the Unit History and then immediately re-set it to "N". 
	</li>
	<li>
	    If you add a contribution onto Pension Master whilst the <i>Allow Manual Update Of
	    Units?</i> flag on the scheme file is set to "Y" and wish that contribution entry
	    to be flagged as unposted (i.e. you wish to use this contribution to allocate units)
	    you should use the Undo menu option in the Unit Posting program to re-set the unit
	    posting flag for this contribution entry for each member concerned for that contribution
	    date. 
	</li>
	<li>
	    If you try to add contributions onto Pension Master whilst the <i>Allow Manual Update
	    Of Units?</i> flag on the scheme file is set to "Y" and the current scheme is either
	    defined contributions or hybrid, either through the <i>Contribution History</i> screen
	    in <i>Member File Maintenance</i> or via <i>the Batch Data Input</i> program, a warning
	    message pops up as follows: <i>Update Units Flag = "Y". Any New Conts Will Default
	    The Unit Post Flag To "Y". </i>You are then asked if you wish to proceed and enter
	    contributions or return to the main menu. This is intended to indicate to the user
	    that they will not be able to post these contributions to units without first using
	    the <i>Undo</i> menu option in the <i>Unit Posting</i> program and that they might
	    consider setting the <i>Allow Manual Update Of Units?</i> Flag on the scheme file
	    to "N" before entering the contribution details. 
	</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>
    The unit posting flag on each contribution entry is now displayed on each members <i>Contribution
    History</i> screen in <i>Member File Maintenance</i>. This is shown in the last column
    on the <i>Contribution History</i> screen. 
</li>
<li>
    Users can now only edit contribution entries on the members <i>Contribution History</i> screen
    in <i>Member File Maintenance</i> where: 
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
    The contribution entry is not a Switch or a Transfer i.e. "S" or "T" does not appear
    in the <i>S/T</i> column on the screen. 
</li>
<li>
    The contribution entry has a unit posting flag of "N" i.e. contributions that have
    already been used to buy units cannot be directly edited without unposting the relevant
    units first (using the <i>Undo</i> menu option in the <i>Unit Posting</i> program). 
</li>
</ul>
