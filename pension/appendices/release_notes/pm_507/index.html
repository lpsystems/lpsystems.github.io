      <h2>Scheme File Maintenance
</h2>
<h3>Basic Scheme Details
</h3>
<p>
This is essentially the same <i>Basic Scheme Details</i> screen as is currently in
Pension Master. Additional fields have been added as follows: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Alternative scheme code - to be used for the an alternative scheme code (if applicable).
    This will be a ten character alphanumeric field which will also be added to the list
    of possible search options in Member File Maintenance. This field will default to
    the same value as the 'Scheme Code' if not filled in otherwise. 
</li>
<li>
    Revenue Reference Number (Ireland). For UK schemes this will be labelled 'ECON'. 
</li>
<li>
    Pensions Board Reference Number (Ireland). For UK schemes this will be labelled 'SCON'. 
</li>
<li>
    (UK only) - PSO Reference Number. For Irish schemes, this field will not be displayed.
    This will be displayed after the 'Pensions Board Reference Number' shown below. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All fields would be held on the scheme file and so would be available to Member Reports
and for mail-merge to Microsoft Word. 
</p>
<p>
The three old State Pension fields will be dropped. The relevant data is now held
in the 'Statutory Amounts Maintenance' program and is accessible via the formulae
using the new stat() function call in release 5.0.5. 
</p>
<p>
The Contracted Out Basis field has also been dropped. This will allow access to the
NI History screen for Defined Contribution schemes. 
</p>
<h3>Investment Funds
</h3>
<p>
This is essentially the same screen as the old 'Documentation/Investment Funds' screen
except that the documentation section of the screen has been separated out into a
new 'Actuarial Details' screen - see later for further details. 
</p>
<p>
This screen has been left deliberately sparse to make space for future planned developments
to Pension Master with regard to extending the capability of investment funds. 
</p>
<h3>Renewal Details
</h3>
<p>
This is a new screen that holds, for each constituent company within a scheme, details
of the progress of the renewal for the current scheme year. An option will also be
available so that the user can view/update details from previous years renewals for
the current scheme. 
</p>
<p>
This allows the administrator to complete the renewal process as and when data is
received, in a case where each company runs their own individual payroll and hence
sends in their own data. This avoids having to wait for the whole scheme to send in
data before any work on the renewal can be processed. 
</p>
<p>
The 'Full/Partial Data Received' field takes the following values: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    P - partial data received. 
</li>
<li>
    F - full data received. 
</li>
<li>
    N or ' ' (blank) - no data received yet. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There will be a separate 'Renewal Status Report' to analyse the renewal data across
a particular scheme or all schemes. 
</p>
<h3>Actuarial Details
</h3>
<p>
This is a new screen. 
</p>
<p>
The first part of the screen is essentially the same as the Documentation part of
the old 'Documentation/Investment Funds' screen. Additional fields have been added
as follows: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Date Last Actuarial Valuation Accepted 
</li>
<li>
    Date Last Member Report Accepted 
</li>
<li>
    Non-selection limit 
</li>
<li>
    Reassurance threshold limit 
</li>
<li>
    PHI Cost 
</li>
<li>
    Current Funding Rate 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All fields would be held on the scheme file and so would be available to Member Reports
and for mail-merge to Microsoft Word. 
</p>
<h3>Address Details
</h3>
<p>
This is a new screen. 
</p>
<p>
This screen would hold details of the addresses in relation to the scheme. Separate
screens with the same format shown as below would be implemented for: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Scheme Address 
</li>
<li>
    Trustees address (if only 1 main trustee address) 
</li>
<li>
    Administrators address 
</li>
<li>
    Actuary's address 
</li>
<li>
    Auditors address 
</li>
<li>
    Legal advisors address 
</li>
<li>
    Miscellaneous address 1 
</li>
<li>
    Miscellaneous address 2 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All fields would be held on the scheme file and so would be available to Member Reports
and for mail-merge to Microsoft Word. 
</p>
<h3>Scheme Level User Defined Fields
</h3>
<p>
This is a new screen. 
</p>
<p>
This screen is designed to hold up to twenty scheme-wide user defined fields in the
same kind of manner as the existing member-level user defined screens. 
</p>
<p>
For each scheme-level user defined field required, the user would enter a description,
a format for the field and the actual field value. 
</p>
<p>
The field format's can any of: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    DT - date 
</li>
<li>
    IN - indicator (Y/N etc.) 
</li>
<li>
    NI - numeric integer 
</li>
<li>
    ND - numeric decimal 
</li>
<li>
    TX - free text 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Two of these fields would be used to hold the Life 400 pension and life policy numbers. 
</p>
<h3>Member Screen Selection
</h3>
<p>
This is a new screen that allows the System Administrator to customise which screens
are available in the member record on a scheme by scheme basis. Also it introduces
the concept of screen based security levels in the member record, so as, for example
salary details can only be viewed by a suitably senior administrator. 
</p>
<p>
The fields are as follows: 
</p>
<p>
<b>DESCRIPTION</b> - This is a view only field that records the internal Pension Master
description e.g. 'Basic Member Details' for each member screen in turn. 
</p>
<p>
<b>DISPLAY</b> - Display this screen for members of this scheme. Valid values are
'Y' or 'N'. 
</p>
<p>
<b>SECURITY LEVEL</b> - Enter the security level for this screen. Valid values are
1 to 99, with 1 being the highest security level. 
</p>
<h3>Broker Details
</h3>
<p>
This is a new screen. 
</p>
<p>
This screen will hold details of the broker assigned to the current scheme by cross
reference to the new 'Broker File Maintenance' module (see later in this document
for further details). 
</p>
<p>
The user enters the 'Broker Code' field, which has a corresponding pop-up F8 picklist
key and the broker details are displayed to the screen and available in the Scheme
Report. 
</p>
<h2>Category File Maintenance
</h2>
<h3>Basic Category Details
</h3>
<p>
This is essentially the same as the basic category details screen as is currently
in Pension Master. Additional fields have been added as follows: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <b>CONT % - EE ORD</b> - to be used for the current employee contribution rate for
    the scheme. This applies only for defined benefits schemes at present. Functionality
    for defined contribution schemes in this regard will be introduced in due course. 
</li>
<li>
    <b>DIS BENEFIT</b> - Min Age/Service For Membership - to be used when adding a member
    who is included in the scheme for life assurance only, and will be used to validate
    the new 'Date Joined For LA' field on the 'Basic Member Details' screen in 'Member
    File Maintenance'. 
</li>
<li>
    <b>Mid Year Entrants Allowed (Y/N)</b> - self explanatory. There are two fields against
    this heading, one for Full Members and another for DIS Members. These will be used
    in the validation of new members for the current scheme and category combination.
    These fields will default to 'N' for all categories. This will also be used by the
    for pro-rating within the appropriate reports. 
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefit Definitions
</h3>
<p>
This is the same as the old 'Benefit Definitions' screen except two extra fields have
been added as follows: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <b>Original Status Type</b> - this will allow Pension Master to only display Quotation
    Types that are relevant to the current member's status i.e. only allow the user to
    run quotes that are relevant for the current user. This field would match against
    the members current status type e.g. A - Actives. Only members that currently have
    this status type would have this Quotation Type displayed in the list of available
    options. A code of 'G' would be created as a global code which would allow the Quotation
    Type to be available to members of all status types. 
</li>
<li>
    <b>Finalised Status Type</b> - this will allow Pension Master to update the members
    status code on finalising Quotation results. This would work in the same way as the
    new 'Original Status Type' field outlined above except that when the user tried to
    finalise the Quotation results, they would be presented with a pop-up list of applicable
    status codes in the specified status type group. The member's status history screen
    would also be updated at this time to reflect the change in status code. This code
    can also be set up to prevent users from being able to finalise a quotation, by using
    a code of 'X', and to only allow the write back of quotation results without updating
    the members status, date left or the quotation finalised flag, by using a code of
    'R'. 
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Status File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
This is the same as the current Status File Maintenance screen except that an extra
field has been added as follows: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Life Assurance Only (Y/N) 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This field will default to 'N' for all status codes, but can be set to 'Y' for those
status codes that are for life assurance only type benefits. 
</p>
<p>
This will then be used within the Pensions Board Fee Invoice Report to determine which
active members are pension members (and not just life assurance only members) and
hence should be included in the Pensions Board Fee Invoice calculations. 
</p>
<p>
It is also used on the Underwriting/Life Assurance Report to determine which members
to total up salary roll for when working out the total funding amount and the total
employee contributions due. 
</p>
<h2>Member File Maintenance
</h2>
<h3>Basic Member Details
</h3>
<p>
This is the same basic member details screen that is currently in Pension Master with
the following exceptions: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Changed 'Date Entered Scheme' field label to 'Date Joined For Pension' to be consistent
    with the new 'Date Joined For LA' field. 
</li>
<li>
    Changed 'Date Entered Category' field label to 'Date Joined For LA'. This is to be
    used to record the date the member was covered for life assurance by the scheme from. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Validation of the 'Date Joined For LA' field would be against the entry conditions
headed 'DIS BENEFITS' on the basic category details screen in Category File Maintenance
(see elsewhere in this note for further details). 
</p>
<p>
With regard to mid year entrants, Pension Master will check to see whether the 'Mid
Year Entrants Allowed (Y/N)' flags on the Category File are set to 'Y' or 'N' for
normal and DIS benefits as appropriate. 
</p>
<p>
If they are set to 'Y' then Pension Master will function exactly as it does as present. 
</p>
<p>
If set to 'N' then Pension Master will only allow the following dates to be dates
that fall on the same day and month as the Renewal Date in the appropriate category
for the member (see the Basic Category Details screen in Category File Maintenance
for further details): 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Date Joined For Pension 
</li>
<li>
    Date Joined For LA 
</li>
<li>
    Qualifying Service Date 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the case of members with entry criteria specified on the category file, who are
also not allowed to join the scheme as mid-year entrants, the appropriate fields on
the member file will default as normal, but will be to the renewal date immediately
after the date they would become eligible to join the scheme, had mid-year entrants
to the scheme been allowed. 
</p>
<p>
When adding a new member the effective date for <i>Company, Category</i> and <i>Status
History</i> entries will default to Date Joined For LA (pm_dect). If this date is
not present then the system will use Date Joined For Pension (pm_des). If this date
is also blank then the system will prompt the user to enter an effective date when
they attempt to save the <i>Basic Details</i> screen. 
</p>
<p>
The security rating checks have also been slightly amended. Users who do not have
a high enough security rating to access member data for a particular scheme, member
or screen will have an appropriate error message displayed. The system will then display
the selected member record with only the basic member details shown in the screen
header box. This allows users to know that a member is present on the database but
they do not sufficient access rights to view or update the members details. 
</p>
<h3>Member Indicators
</h3>
<p>
This is the same member indicators screen as is currently in Pension Master with the
following exception: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    New 'Member Medically Loaded' field 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This field takes the values 'Y' or 'N' and will automatically default to 'N'. It is
used to indicate to the administrator whether this member has a medical loading imposed.
It is purely an indicator and no supporting calculations are deemed to be necessary.
The user will detail the loading and the benefit to which it applies on the notes
screen. 
</p>
<p>
The medically loaded members life assurance premium will be calculated normally, i.e.
without applying the loading. 
</p>
<p>
The value of this field is printed on the new 'Underwriting/Life Assurance Report'
for use by underwriters. 
</p>
<h3>Member Quotation Screen
</h3>
<p>
This has been changed to only display appropriate Quotation Types depending on the
members Status Type, the Quotations Original Status Type and finalised status. 
</p>
<p>
The old <i>Termination Date (pm_dterm_dt)</i> field seen in previous releases of Pension
Master has been replaced with a new field - <i>Calculation Date</i>. This will serve
as the effective date of the Quotation i.e. Date of Leaving, Date of Retirement etc. <i>Termination
Date</i> will be calculated in the background as before (defaulting to <i>Calculation
Date</i> or <i>Date Left</i> if present) so existing occurrences of <i>pm_dterm_dt</i> in
formulae will continue to work as before. The creation of this C<i>alculation Date</i> field
is held for each Quotation Type as opposed to <i>Termination Date</i> which is a single
field that held the date entered for the last Quotation run for the member. The <i>Calculation
Date</i> can be used in formulae by using the code <i>pmqh_calcdate(TYPE) </i>were <i>TYPE</i> is
the appropriate Quotation Type. 
</p>
<p>
Once a Quotation Type has been selected, the user will be able to run the calculation
as before. 
</p>
<p>
Once a Quotation has been run, the user can opt to finalise it providing that the <i>Finalised
Status Type</i> for the Quotation Type on the Category File allows it. The action
of finalising a Quotation has been extended to update the members <i>Status History</i> and <i>Date
Left</i> if the member is changing from an active status to a non-active one. This
will only happen if the <i>Finalised Status Type</i> has not been entered as 'X' (Prevent
Finalise) or 'R' (Write back results only). The act of unfinalising a Quotation will
remove the entry from <i>Status History</i> and reset the members <i>Date Left</i> to
blank if they are changing from a non-active status to an active one. 
</p>
<h3>Member Search Facility
</h3>
<p>
Include the new 'Alternative Scheme Code' field on the 'Basic Scheme Details' screen
in 'Scheme File Maintenance' in the list of possible search criteria for members of
a pension scheme. 
</p>
<h2>Broker File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
This is a new module which would hold the following details for each possible broker: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Broker Code 
</li>
<li>
    Broker Name 
</li>
<li>
    Broker Address (4 lines plus postcode) 
</li>
<li>
    Broker telephone number 
</li>
<li>
    Broker contact name 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This data would then be linked in to individual scheme records via the new 'Broker
Details' screen in 'Scheme File Maintenance'. 
</p>
<p>
The 'Broker Code' field is a 5 character field that permits all alphanumeric characters. 
</p>
<h2>Underwriting/Life Assurance Report
</h2>
<p>
This is a new report and will first of all calculate the non-selection (or free cover)
limit. This will be done by looking at all members of the scheme whose status type
is 'A' (i.e. all active members of the scheme), multiplying the result by 10,000 and
subjecting this to an overall maximum of 700,000. The resulting value will automatically
update the new 'Non-Selection Limit' field on the new 'Actuarial Details' screen in
'Scheme File Maintenance'. 
</p>
<p>
A report will then be produced by analysing the life assurance benefit and the capitalised
spouses in service benefit values that have been held on an appropriate user defined
screen. This will allow the user to select by scheme code and for all the members
within that scheme, output a report as follows: 
</p>
<p>
This report would also show the amount for joiners in the last year, pro-rated by
reference to the 'Date Joined For LA' (date the member joined the scheme for death
benefits) field and up to and including the day before the renewal date. 
</p>
<p>
All active members (those members with a status type of 'A' corresponding to their
respective status code) will be used in both the calculation of the NSL and the corresponding
report. 
</p>
<h2>Pensions Board Fee Invoice Report
</h2>
<p>
This is a new report and is applicable to Irish based schemes only. 
</p>
<p>
It is required to calculate and print out the amount of the fees due for the scheme
in respect of the annual Pensions Board Fee. This will then be put into an invoice
and can used to bill the client for the amount due. The calculation is based on the
number of active pension scheme members, excluding members who life assurance only. 
</p>
<p>
All active members (those members with a status type of 'A' corresponding to their
respective status code), but excluding life assurance only members will be used in
both the calculation of the amount due. This will be by reference to the new 'Life
Assurance Only' field on 'Status File Maintenance' (see elsewhere in this document
for further details). 
</p>
<h2>Premium Calculation Report
</h2>
<p>
This is a new report. 
</p>
<p>
It is required to show the amount of premium due in respect of each scheme. 
</p>
<p>
The user selects the scheme for which they wish to run the report and indicates which
type of salary to use for each of the employee and employer contributions e.g. A =
Gross Salary, B = Scheme Salary etc. etc. 
</p>
<p>
The data used is as follows: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Employee Contributions is calculated by using the 'EE ORD CONT%' and the relevant
    salary details. 
</li>
<li>
    The total salary roll is calculated by summing up all the latest salaries for active
    members of the scheme. 
</li>
<li>
    Funding Rate is taken from the new 'Actuarial Details' screen in 'Scheme File Maintenance' 
</li>
<li>
    Life assurance cost will be obtained in the same way as the data for the Underwriting/Life
    Assurance Report mentioned earlier. 
</li>
<li>
    PHI Cost is taken from the new 'Actuarial Details' screen in 'Scheme File Maintenance'.
    This field is manually updated by the user from an external PHI system. 
</li>
<li>
    The Medical Loading field is a run time input by the user on the report and can be
    used for any additional items that are required to be offset in the calculation of
    employers contribution. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This report would also show the amount for joiners in the last year, pro-rated by
reference to the 'Date Joined For LA' (date the member joined the scheme for life
assurance) field and up to and including the day before the renewal date. 
</p>
<h2>Renewal Status Report
</h2>
<p>
This is a new report. 
</p>
<p>
It is required to analyse the details held on the new 'Renewal Details' screen in
'Scheme File Maintenance' in order to allow the administrator to analyse the current
status of renewals on Pension Master. 
</p>
<p>
The user can print the report for a particular broker code or for all brokers on Pension
Master. The report enables the user to: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    find out which renewals are not yet completed. 
</li>
<li>
    find out where data is still outstanding for each renewal. 
</li>
<li>
    find out where no data has been received. 
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Formula File Maintenance
</h2>
<h3>Revised Functions
</h3>
<p>
Extended the functions <i>avg() </i>and <i>avgmax() </i>with extra arguments to allow
more conditions in the selection of appropriate amounts. The User Manual pages are
shown below: 
</p>
<pre><b>avg(field,n,fld1,fld2) OVERVIEW </b>Use the avg function to calculate
the average of a history field over a particular number of years. <b>SYNTAX </b>avg(field,n,fld1,fld2) <b>EXPLANATION </b>field&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is a field on the salary history or contribution &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
history files (pe_defsal or pe_defhst_b respectively). n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is the number of years to average the history field over. fld1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is the effective start conditions of the averaging. fld2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is the basis of the averaging. <b>NOTES</b></pre>
<ol>
<li>
    If n = 0, the function will return a value of 0. 
</li>
<li>
    n can take any value less than 40. i.e. you can average the history field over no
    more than 40 years. 
</li>
<li>
    fld1 can take the alphabetic values 'e' and 'l'. 'e' will commence the averaging period
    from Calculation Date. 'l' will commence the averaging period from Calculation Date
    but will ignore the latest entry. 
</li>
<li>
    fld2 can take the values 1, 2, 3 and 4. 1 will average extracted amounts using the
    highest amount if there is more than one in the same calendar year. 2 will average
    extracted amounts using the first amount if there is more than one in the same calendar
    year. 3 will average extracted amounts recorded at the renewal dd/mm as recorded on <i>Scheme
    File Maintenance</i>. 4 will average extracted amounts using the period the amount
    was effective for. 
</li>
</ol>
<b> 
<p>
EXAMPLES
</p></b> avg(pds_pensal,3,e,1) avg(pds_grsal,1,l,4) avg(pdb_ee_ord_c,4,e,2) 
<pre><b>avgmax(fld,n1,n2,fld1,fld2) OVERVIEW</b> Use the avgmax function to
calculate the best band of consecutive years history over a given period. e.g. to
calculate the best three year average gross salary over the last ten years. <b>SYNTAX </b>avgmax(field,n1,n2,fld1,fld2) <b>EXPLANATION </b>field&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is a field on the salary history or contribution &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
history files (pe_defsal or pe_defhst_b respectively). n1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is the number of years to find the best consecutive n2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
years average over. n2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is the number of consecutive years to average the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
history field over. fld1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is the effective start conditions of the averaging. fld2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is the basis of the averaging. <b>NOTES</b></pre>
<ol>
<li>
    If n1 = 0 or n2 = 0, the function will return a value of 0. 
</li>
<li>
    n1 can take any value less than 40. i.e. you can average the history field over no
    more than 40 years. 
</li>
<li>
    If n2 &gt; number of years history for a particular member then the function performs
    the average over the number of years history data available. e.g. if you try to use
    avgmax(pds_grsal,10,3,e,1) and there is only two years gross salary details for a
    particular member, the function will look at consecutive two year averages of gross
    salary to arrive at the result. 
</li>
<li>
    fld1 can take the alphabetic values 'e' and 'l'. 'e' will commence the averaging period
    from Calculation Date. 'l' will commence the averaging period from Calculation Date
    but will ignore the latest entry.

    fld2 can take the values 1, 2, 3 and 4. 1 will average extracted amounts using the
    highest amount if there is more than one in the same calendar year. 2 will average
    extracted amounts using the first amount if there is more than one in the same calendar
    year. 3 will average extracted amounts recorded at the renewal dd/mm as recorded on <i>Scheme
    File Maintenance</i>. 4 will average extracted amounts using the period the amount
    was effective for.

<h3>New Functions
</h3>
<p>
Added new functions to the Formula file to allow users to incorporate data items from
the Member Quotation Header record (pe_mquote_h). This code, similar to the Member
Quotation Results code, will allow users to extract Calculation Date for the Quotation
into their formulae. The User Manual page is shown below: 
</p>
<pre><b>#quotation_header_field(type) OVERVIEW</b> Use this to refer to the
member quotation header fields for a quotation&nbsp; that has already been run for
the current member. This will be taken from&nbsp; the quotation header file (pe_mquote_h). <b>SYNTAX </b>#quotation_header_field(type) <b>EXPLANATION </b>type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
refers to the Quotation Type (see Category File Maintenance) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
that you wish to return a quotation header field for. This &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
must be in UPPERCASE and must exist as a valid Quotation Type &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
for the appropriate Category for each member that this formula &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is to be used for. If this is not the case, this function will &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
return a value of 0. <b>NOTES</b></pre>
<ol>
<li>
    quote_header_field must be a valid field on the Member Quotation Header File (pe_mquote_h). 
</li>
<li>
    type must be in UPPERCASE. 
</li>
<li>
    type must exist for the appropriate Category for each member that this formula is
    to be used to run quotations for. 
</li>
<li>
    If the quote_header_field is not found, either because it does not exist, has not
    yet been run, or results from incorrect specification of type, this function call
    will return a value of 0. 
</li>
</ol>
<b> 
<p>
EXAMPLES
</p></b> #pmqh_calcdate(NORM) extracts the calculation date for the Quotation Type
NORM for each member concerned. #pmqh_last_run(CERT) extracts the last run date for
the Quotation Type CERT for each member concerned. 
<h2>Batch Quotation Run
</h2>
<p>
This facility has been extended to allow Quotation results to be finalised on a bulk
basis. An extra menu item <i>Finalise</i> has been added to facilitate this. 
</p>
<p>
After selecting the Finalise option and entering the Quotation details a screen displaying
the extracted members and a finalised flag will appear. The user will be able to amend
the default finalised status and also be able to deselect members from being finalised
by changing their flag from 'Y' to 'N'. 
</p>
<p>
If the finalised flag is shown as 'R' then this indicates that only the quotation
results will be written back to the members relevant <i>User Defined Screen. </i>The
members status, date left and the quotation finalised flag will not be updated. 
</p>
<p>
If there is a problem with finalising a members quotation i.e. the quotation is not
selected as being able to finalise, the quotation has not been run at the entered <i>Calculation
Date</i> or their Finalised Status does not agree with the <i>Finalised Status Type</i> for
the quotation, then the finalised flag will be set to 'X'. This will result in the
members quotation not being finalised. 
</p>
<p>
Once the extracted list has been accepted, <i>Pension Master</i> will finalise the
quotation for those members with a 'Y' flag and write back the quotation results for
those with a 'R' flag. A <i>Finalised Report</i> is then available which will list
those members whose quotation was finalised 'Y', those whose results were written
back, 'R, those who were flagged not to be finalised, 'N', and those who could be
finalised with a reason why, 'X'. 
</p>
<h2>Lock File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
Introduced a new <i>Lock File Maintenance</i> program to deal with cases where the
user is trying to update information that another user is already updating. As soon
as a user chooses <i>Update</i> in any part of Pension Master, a lock is created in
the lock file which indicates what program the user is in and what item of data they
are currently updating e.g. if the user is updating the contribution history of member
number 13426, a lock file with Lock ID of pem_mcon13426 is created. When the user
exits input mode and returns to the program menu, the relevant lock file is removed,
allowing other users immediate access to that record. 
</p>
<p>
If a program exits abnormally whilst the user is updating a piece of information,
the lock will remain in force and the <i>System Administrator</i> should use the <i>Lock
File Maintenance</i> program to remove the lock, thus allowing the user update access
to the record again. Further details can be found in the <i>User Manual</i>. 
</p>
<h2>Renewal Listing Report
</h2>
<p>
This is a new report. 
</p>
<p>
It can be run across all schemes on Pension Master and will show details of when the
renewal date is for each scheme. The user can select the month to run the report for,
if they require, for example, details of the renewals coming up next month, or they
can run the report for all months. This will then show renewal dates for all schemes,
grouped by month.
