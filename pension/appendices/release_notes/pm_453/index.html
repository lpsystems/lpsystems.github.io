      <h2>New Features
</h2>
<ol>
<li>
    Fixed bug in <i>ir_revmax()</i> in <i>Formula File Maintenance</i> in the case of
    the use of the EL/DL option. The bug arose where a member's actual service was less
    than 20 years. This is detailed in note 10 of Joan Whelan's note of 18/12/96. 
</li>
<li>
    Fixed bug in <i>Batch File Maintenance</i> when adding a member to a contribution
    batch where the scheme concerned is defined as a hybrid scheme in <i>Scheme File Maintenance</i>.
    The system now correctly checks that the member has an investment choice set up on
    his/her record in the <i>Member Investment Choice</i> screen of <i>Member File Maintenance</i>.
    If not, the program prompts the user to do so before allowing them to add any contribution
    details for this member to the batch. This is covered by note 9 in Joan Whelan's note
    of 18/12/96. 
</li>
<li>
    The <i>avgmin()</i> function has been removed from <i>Formula File Maintenance</i> as
    this was superfluous to requirements and has never been used by anyone despite being
    available in <i>Pension Master</i> for a number of years now. 
</li>
<li>
    Fixed a small bug in the expense calculation routine for cases where contributions
    were added/updated through the <i>Member File Maintenance</i> program. This was causing
    expenses to be added on top of existing expenses rather than be re-calculated from
    scratch every time a contribution was updated. This is detailed in note 3 of Joan
    Whelan's note of 18/12/96. 
</li>
<li>
    Following on from point 4) above, expenses for a particular contribution entry are
    now calculated as the cursor leaves the row on the screen for that particular contribution
    entry and not as it used to be where expenses were only calculated when the user saved
    the contribution details by pressing <i>Esc</i> at the end of editing contribution
    details. 
</li>
<li>
    Furthermore, expenses are only re-calculated for an existing contribution entry if
    the user actally changes some of the contribution details for that entry e.g. alters
    the amount of the employee ordinary contributions. 
</li>
<li>
    Altered the way errors are handled by the <i>Pension Master</i> software so that when
    an error is encountered a window opens up on the screen with a red background and
    displays the error message. The user is then required to press any key to continue.
    This contrasts with the old sytle error messages which were displayed in red reverse
    on the line at the bottom of the screen and were often unnoticed by users. 
</li>
<li>
    Added an extra field entitled <i>Document Name</i> to the first screen in the <i>Mail-Merge
    Integration Report</i>. This can be used to store the name (and directory if required)
    of the document you wish to mail-merge your data into e.g. G:\JOHN\TEST.DOC. 
</li>
<li>
    Removed the <i>Letter/Cert</i> option from the <i>Scheme File Maintenance</i> main
    menu as this is only relevant to those users who have <i>Uniplex</i> as their default
    word processor and was never really used much anyway. 
</li>
<li>
    Amended the <i>Mail-Merge Integration Report</i> for users of Microsoft Word so that
    immediately after the report is processed, it calls a shell script called <i>merge.com</i> which
    can be used, for example, to move the merge data document <i>merge.doc</i> to another
    directory which may be of use to those instances where Pension Master is setup to
    co-exist with a Novell Netware network. Simply edit the file <i>merge.com</i> which
    is in the <i>/u/LandP/progs</i> directory to perform the necessary actions. 
</li>
<li>
    Fixed a bug in <i>avgmax()</i> where if there were three or more salaries in the same
    calendar year, the highest of the three was not necessarily used in the calculations. 
</li>
<li>
    Added a new sub-menu <i>OUTPUT</i> to the <i>Member Report</i> program which allows
    the user to choose whether they wish to produce the report in normal report format
    or in comma-separated value (.CSV) format. The .CSV format is suitable for importing
    data directly into numerous DOS/Windows applications e.g. Microsoft Excel. See the
    separate note produced by <i>L&amp;P Systems Limited</i> which gives further details
    of how to do this. 
</li>
<li>
    Amended the <i>Member Report</i> in the case where the user chooses the <i>eXport</i> menu
    option so that immediately after the report is processed, it calls a shell script
    called <i>pension.com</i> which can be used, for example, to move the data document <i>pension.csv</i> to
    another directory which may be of use to those instances where Pension Master is setup
    to co-exist with a Novell Netware network. Simply edit the file <i>pension.com</i> which
    is in the <i>/u/LandP/progs</i> directory to perform the necessary actions. 
</li>
<li>
    In the <i>Unit Posting</i> program, only ask the user to print the report off if some
    units were actually posted. 
</li>
