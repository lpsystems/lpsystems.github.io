      <h2>Details Of The Changes
</h2>
<ol>
<li>
    Amended the Part Time Service record. This makes the recording of the part time hours
    worked for members easier and does not now require you to enter a complete service
    history, regardless of wether the member was part time or not. 
    <p>
	If a member commences part time service then the start date, the amount of hours worked
	and the full time hours standard should be recorded. When the member returns to full
	time service or the amount of part time hours change, the end date should be entered. 
    </p>
    <p>
	Equivalent service periods are automatically calculated in <b>days</b> as the user
	moves from each line. 
    </p>
    <p>
	The pt(date1,date2) function is now available for use in your formulae via <i>Formula
	File Maintenance</i>. This will calculate a ratio of part time service to actual period
	ratio which can then be applied to service or salaries to get the part time equivalent
	of full time service. The manual page for this is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
	<b>pt(date1,date2)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
	<b>OVERVIEW</b> 
	<br />
	Use the pt function to calculate the full time
	equivalent service ratio 
	<br />
	from a Part Time Service record. 
    </p>
    <p>
	<b>SYNTAX</b> 
	<br />
	pt(date1,date2) 
    </p>
    <p>
	<b>EXPLANATION</b> 
	<br />
	date1 start date for date period 
	<br />
	date2 end date for date period 
    </p>
    <p>
	<b>NOTES</b> 
	<br />
	The two dates must be field references to the member
	file (pe_mem), 
	<br />
	constant dates entered in the format YYYYMMDD,
	where YYYY is the year, MM 
	<br />
	is the month and DD is the day or references to
	the result of another line 
	<br />
	of formula code within the current formula e.g.
	@1. 
    </p>
    <p>
	If date1 &gt; date2 the value returned will be
	0. 
    </p>
    <p>
	The ratio will be calculated as the total equivalent
	service recorded 
	<br />
	between date1 and date2 on the Part Time Service
	record plus the remaining 
	<br />
	service (assumed to be at full time), divided by
	the period between date1 
	<br />
	and date2. 
    </p>
    <p>
	This is displayed as a 2 decimal place result but
	is available in the 
	<br />
	calculating formula to 8 decimal places. 
    </p>
    <p>
	<b>EXAMPLES</b> 
	<br />
	pt(pm_des,pm_npd) 
	<br />
	pt(19950122,pm_dterm_dt) 
	<br />
	pt(19900406,19960405) 
	<br />
	pt(@1,19960405) 
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    Amended the <i>cty(), cy(), cm(), cd(), hy(), hm()</i> and <i>pt()</i>functions in <i>Formula
    File Maintenance</i> so that the user can now access the results of other lines of
    formulae as arguments to these functions in the format <i>@line_num</i>. 
</li>
<li>
    For example, if you wish to calculate the period in years and completed months between
    the date of transfer in number 1 and Normal Pension Date, use the following formula
    code: 
    <br />
    <ol>
    <li>
    transfer(ptv_date,2,1)
    </li>
    <li>
    cm(@1,pm_npd)
    </li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>
    Amended the screen selection pop-up menu in <i>Member File Maintenance</i> so that
    a window now appears that displays all the available screens for the current scheme
    type at once, together with the corresponding screen numbers. The user is invited
    to select the screen they wish to view by simply entering the screen number. This
    replaces the old scrolling menu that was found to be cumbersome to use. The new facility
    allows the user to rapidly move from one screen to another. 
</li>
<li>
    Screen numbers are consistent regardless of the scheme type currently selected i.e.
    the <i>Quotation Screen</i> is always screen 27. 
</li>
<li>
    Added a lookup facility in <i>Member File Maintenance</i> for the Query option on
    Status Type, Marital Status and Sex. Available by clicking on the 'Search' button. 
</li>
</ol>
