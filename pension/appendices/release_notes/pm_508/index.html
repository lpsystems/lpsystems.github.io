      <h2>Member File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
Added a new field <i>pm_age</i> to <i>Member File Maintenance</i> to store age for
the member. This is also displayed on the <i>Basic Member Details</i> screen. The
field is dynamically calculated each time you go into this screen, add a member, run
a <i>Member Report</i> or <i>Mail Merge Integration Report</i> or a formula that references
this new field. The way this is calculated differs on which program you are using
as follows: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Member File Maintenance - always calculate age at today's date i.e. the system date. 
</li>
<li>
    Member Report/Mail-Merge Integration Report - always calculate age at the report date. 
</li>
<li>
    Formula File/Quotations - always calculate age at quotation date. 
</li>
</ul>
<div class="info">
	    <p>System Administrators: The field will default to calculating age last birthday.&nbsp;
	    If you wish your Pension Master system to calculate age next birthday instead, and
	    to retain that for all future use, you will need to change the Calculate Age Next
	    (N) or Last (L) Birthday field in the System Parameter Maintenance program as appropriate.</p>
</div>
<h2>Category File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
Added new entry validation fields for <i>Maximum Age For Joining</i>. These fields
are set up for Full and DIS Only Membership and will default to the highest of the
male and female NPA if left blank. 
</p>
<p>
<i>Date Joined For LA</i> and <i>Date Joined For Pension</i> fields on the <i>Member
Basic Record</i> will be validated against these maximum fields and users will be
warned if the dates entered exceed them. 
</p>
<h2>Member File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
Added a new flag <i>Capitalise Names/Text Fields (Y/N)</i> to the <i>System Parameter
Maintenance</i> program to allow the user to switch on the automatic casing of certain
fields. At present the following fields are supported: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Title 
</li>
<li>
    Forename 
</li>
<li>
    Surname 
</li>
<li>
    Job Title 
</li>
<li>
    Member's address 
</li>
<li>
    Member's salutation 
</li>
<li>
    Full forenames 
</li>
</ul>
<div class="info">
	    <p>System Administrators: The field will default to casing these fields. If
	    you wish your Pension Master system not to do this, for example, if you are an Irish
	    site with Gaelic surnames, you will have to change the Capitalise Names/Text Fields
	    Y(/N) field in the System Parameter Maintenance program to 'N'.</p>
</div>
<h2>Member File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
Extended the member search facility so that when more than one member is selected
using the <i>Query</i> option, a search list is displayed to the screen showing basic
details of each member selected. This allows the user to navigate the list and once
they have found the member they require, press <i>Return</i> to select the record.
The total number of member records selected is also displayed to this list for information
purposes only. 
</p>
<p>
This replaces the old member selection method whereby the first record of a group
of members was displayed to the screen and the user then had to use the <i>Next</i> and <i>Previous</i> keys
to navigate between the members. 
</p>
<p>
Once a member record has been selected using the new method outlined above, the old <i>Next</i> and <i>Previous</i> keys
are still available should the user wish to scroll through the records in the old
way. 
</p>
<p>
For users of the new GUI release of Pension Master, a <i>Quick Search</i> button is
available which will re-display the pop-up window showing basic details of all the
members selected to enable the user to quickly locate any other member records they
wish to update/view. 
</p>
<h2>Reports Menu
</h2>
<p>
Re-organised the reports menu in Pension Master to incorporate several sub-menus since
the number of reports now available as standard in Pension Master exceeds the space
available on the old single Reports menu. The new layout is as follows and will be
installed by default by running the Pension Master installation/upgrade program. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <b>Report Writer</b>

    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The reports on the <i>Standard Reports</i> menu outlined above are to be implemented
in a future release of Pension Master and are included on the menu at this stage for
completeness only. 
</p>
<div class="info">
	    <p>System Administrators: You will need to make the extra menu options available to
	    users as appropriate by granting access using the User File Maintenance module of
	    Pension Master. By default all new menus and menu options added to Pension Master
	    will not be switched on for any users.</p>
</div>
<h2>User File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
Dropped the field <i>Pension Administrator</i> from <i>User File Maintenance</i> as
this field is no longer required in Pension Master. 
</p>
<p>
Added two new fields to the program as follows: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    System Administrator 
</li>
<li>
    Supervisor 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Details of how these fields are implemented in Pension Master are to be found in the <i>Security
Features In Pension Master</i> chapter of the Pension Master User Manual. 
</p>
<div class="info">
	    <p>System Administrators Note: You will need to manually set these fields as appropriate
	    for each user by using the User File Maintenance module of Pension Master. By
	    default both these new fields will be set to 'N' for all users.</p>
	    <p>We recommend that you read and fully understand the consequences outlined in the
	    Security Features In Pension Master chapter of the Pension Master User Manual before
	    doing this.</p>
</div>
<h2>Member File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
Added validation for the NI number field so as to force it to conform with rules set
down by the Inland Revenue/Contributions Agency. 
</p>
<p>
If the user does not know a member's NI number and they have input a valid date of
birth and sex for the member, upon entering the member's date of birth, the user is
asked whether they wish Pension Master to generate a temporary NI number for the member.
If they do, a temporary NI number is generated in the format TNDDMMYYX where DD =
day of birth, MM = month of birth, YY = year of birth and X = 'M' or 'F' dependent
on the member's sex, and displayed to the NI number field on the screen. 
</p>
<h2>Member File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
Amended the <i>Company</i>, <i>Category</i> and <i>Status History </i>screens to allow
users to add lines of history and amend old and new codes. The system will carry out
various checks to ensure that the <i>Old Code</i> matches the <i>New Code</i> from
the previous line and also checks that the entered codes are valid. <i>Effective Dates</i> are
also validated to ensure that histories are entered in chronological order. 
</p>
<p>
A link between the <i>New Code</i> of the latest entry on each of the history screens
to the members <i>Company</i>, <i>Category</i> and <i>Status</i> fields shown in the
top box of each member record screen. If the latest <i>New Code</i> differs from the
members current value for <i>Company</i>, <i>Category</i> or <i>Status</i> then they
will be warned that the current value will be updated if the screen is saved followed
by a prompt to allow the user to prevent this. 
</p>
<h2>Reports
</h2>
<p>
One new report option has been added in the <i>Standard</i> reports sub menu: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    The <i>Temporary/Missing NI Numbers Report</i> can be used to check NI numbers that
    have not been entered, or temporary NI numbers which are incorrect. The report suggests
    a temporary NI number based on the rules out-lined in the <i>Member File Maintenance</i> section
    above. If the Date of Birth or Sex have not been entered then a temporary NI number
    cannot be generated. In this case a comment is printed showing the action to be taken.
    If correct temporary NI numbers can be generated, then the user will be asked if an
    automatic update is required. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Three new report options has been added in the <i>Membership Analysis</i> reports
sub menu: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    The <i>Member Status Analysis Report</i> allows the user to produce a count of the
    Members per Scheme grouped by their current Status code. The report will be of great
    use following the take on of new scheme data and will aid the checking of members
    being loaded. 
</li>
<li>
    The <i>Unposted Contributions Report</i> can be used to check units that have not
    been posted to Investment Funds. The report can be generated to show Member and Unposted
    Contribution details with sub-totals for each member. The other format is the total
    Unposted Contribution for each Investment Fund with totals by Scheme. 
</li>
<li>
    The <i>Unposted Switch/Transfer Report</i> allows the user to check members that have
    incomplete Switch/Transfers remaining. The user can select members by Scheme or report
    on all member records in Pension Master. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
One new report option has been added under the <i>Miscellaneous Reports</i> sub menu: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    The <i>Reconciliation Report</i> can be used to check on the number of members in
    a scheme or selection of schemes and also their total salaries, contributions and
    the number of lines of data in these two records. The report can be run to give member
    totals or just scheme totals depending on the option selected. We envisage this report
    being of great use following the take on of new scheme data and will aid the checking
    of the loading of members and salaries and contributions. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A new suite of report options have been added under the <i>Standard Reports</i> sub
menu called <i>Current Actives</i>, <i>Current Preserveds</i> and <i>Current Pensioners
Reports</i>. These reports have been created to provide a standard set of basic details
for those selected members whose status code has the appropriate status type (<i>A</i>, <i>D</i> or <i>P</i>). 
</p>
<div class="info">
	    <p>System Administrators: You will need to make these new menu options available to
	    users as appropriate by granting access using the User File Maintenance module of
	    Pension Master. By default all new menus and menu options added to Pension Master
	    will not be switched on for any users.</p>
</div>
<h2>Miscellaneous Fieldname Changes
</h2>
<p>
Various fields on the Pension Master database have been re-named to make them more
consistent with other database tables and more adequately describe their purpose.
The fields that are affected are: 
</p>
<table cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
    <tr>
	<th>
	    Old Fieldname</th>
	<th>
	    New Fieldname</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td>
	    pm_emp_cat</td>
	<td>
	    pm_category</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td>
	    pm_des</td>
	<td>
	    pm_djp</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td>
	    pm_dect</td>
	<td>
	    pm_djla</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
All references to these fields in your formulae and reports will be automatically
updated to the new format by the Pension Master installation program 
</p>
<h2>Member File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
Swapped positions of <i>Date Joined For Life Assurance</i> and <i>Date Joined For
Pension</i> fields round on the <i>Basic Member Details</i> screen in <i>Member File
Maintenance</i> so as to be more meaningful to the user. The fields are now displayed
with <i>Date Joined For Life Assurance</i> date before <i>Date Joined For Pension</i>. 
</p>
<h2>Member File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
Amended the way Pension Master creates a contribution entry in respect of a transfer
in for defined contribution or hybrid type schemes. This only applies for Irish schemes.
UK schemes continue to be handled in the way they have been for some time, which is
set out in the User Manual. The contribution entry is calculated as follows: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EE ORD = MEMBERS ORD CONTS INCLUDED 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EE AVC = AVC'S INCLUDED 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ER ORD = TRANSFER VALUE - (EE ORD + EE AVC) 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EE PRRTS = 0 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ER PRRTS = 0 
</p>
<h2>Member File Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
After running a quotation, the quotation screen print now includes a printout of any
member notes (if they exist) and the basic member indicator details from the <i>Member
Indicators </i>screen. It is envisaged that these will be used as a useful tool when
independently checking calculations prior to quoting them to a member.
