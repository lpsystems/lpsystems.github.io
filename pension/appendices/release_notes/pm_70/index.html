		<b>EXPLANATION</b> 
	    </p>
	    <ul>
		<li>
		    cont_type - is the contribution type code 
		</li>
		<li>
		    func_type - denotes whether you wish to do a total for contributions (C), expenses
		    (E) or units (U). Note the capitalisation. 
		</li>
		<li>
		    fund - is the investment fund code 
		</li>
		<li>
		    type - denotes the transaction type you wish to include e.g. BUY, TRANSFER, SWITCH.
		    This should default to BUY. 
		</li>
		<li>
		    flag - denotes which date on pe_minv table to do the comparisons on as follows: 
		    <ul>
			<li>
			    1 - date due 
			</li>
			<li>
			    2 - date received 
			</li>
			<li>
			    3 - date invested 
			</li>
		    </ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		    date1 - is the start date for the period required 
		</li>
		<li>
		    date2 - is the end date for the period required 
		</li>
	    </ul>
	    <b>NOTES</b> 
	    <ol>
		<li>
		    If date1 &gt; date2 the value the total will be calculated with a term of 0. 
		</li>
		<li>
		    The two dates must be field references to date fields on the member file (pe_mem),
		    constant dates entered in the format YYYYMMDD where YYYY is the year, MM is the month
		    and DD is the day or references to the result of another line of formula code within
		    the current formula e.g. @1. 
		</li>
		<li>
		    Fund can be set to 'TOT', this means look at the total contribution rather than that
		    part of the contribution for an individual fund in the case where a member invests
		    their contribution in more than one fund. 
		</li>
		<li>
		    If func_type is set to 'E' then fund <b>MUST EQUAL 'TOT'.</b> 
		</li>
		<li>
		    If func_type is set to 'U' then the fund <b>CANNOT EQUAL 'TOT'.</b> 
		</li>
		<li>
		    If fund equals 'TOT' then <b>FLAG CANNOT EQUAL 3.</b> 
		</li>
		<li>
		    If func_type is set to 'U' then the type <b>CAN EQUAL 'ALL'</b> which will allow all transaction types to be included in the calculation.</b>
