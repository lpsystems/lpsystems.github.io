      <h2>Details Of The Changes
</h2>
<ol>
<li>
    <i>Date Contracted Out</i> in the <i>Basic Member Details </i>screen of <i>Member
    File Maintenance</i> now defaults to <i>Date Started Pensionable Service</i> (pm_dps),
    or 6/4/1978 if later, rather than to <i>Date Entered Scheme </i>(pm_des), or 6/4/1978
    if later, so as to allow for schemes where pensionable service commenced before the
    member joined the current scheme, for example in the case of a bulk buyout into a
    new scheme. 
</li>
<li>
    There are occasions where members can be in a contracted out scheme but remain contracted
    in. To allow for this senario users will be able to update <i>Date Contracted Out</i> in
    the <i>Basic Member Details</i> screen to be blank but they will be prompted to confirm
    that they wish to leave this date blank. The same facility is available if this field
    is shown as <i>Qualifying Service Date</i> (Irish schemes only). 
</li>
<li>
    <p>Added a new function called <i>exptot() </i>which has been copied from the existing <i>conttot()</i> function
    except it calculates total expenses between two given dates for a particular expense
    source and investment fund. The manual page for this is as follows:</p>
<p><b>exptot(flag,nn,date1,date2)</b></p>
<p><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>
<p>Use the exptot function to calculate the total expenses between two given dates for a particular contribution source.</p>
<p><b>SYNTAX</b></p>
<p>exptot(flag,nn,date1,date2)</p>
<p><b>EXPLANATION</b></p>
<p>flag - This is used to denote the contribution source and can take the values 1 - 6 as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>EE Ordinary Expenses</li>
<li>EE AVC Expenses</li>
<li>ER Ordinary Expenses</li>
<li>EE Protected Rights Expenses</li>
<li>ER Protected Rights Expenses</li>
<li>Total Expenses nn is the investment fund number you require expense totals for. Valid values are between 00 and 20. date1 is the start date for the period required. date2 is the end date for the period required.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>NOTES</b></p>
    <ol>
	<li>
	    If date1 &gt; date2 the value the total will be calculated with a term of 0. 
	</li>
	<li>
	    The two dates must be field references to date fields on the member file (pe_mem)
	    or constant dates entered in the format YYYYMMDD where YYYY is the year, MM is the
	    month and DD is the day. 
	</li>
	<li>
	    The investment fund number must be in the format nn i.e. for fund 1 you must enter
	    01, for fund 20 you must enter 20. 
	</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>EXAMPLES</b></p>
<p>exptot(1,03,19950112,pm_npd)<br />exptot(3,01,pm_dps,pm_dtlft)<br />exptot(2,19,19950112,20031115)</p>
</li>
<li>
    Amended the <i>Actuarial Analysis Report</i> so that it now allows you to access Quotation
    Results fields held on the table pe_mquote. This has necessitated the use of arguments
    in certain field names in a similar way to that recently introduced in the <i>Member
    Report</i>, <i>Full Members Listing</i> and <i>Mail-Merge Integration Report</i>.
    The fields affected are as follows: 
    <table cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
	    <tr>
		<th>
		    Table</th>
		<th>
		    Argument 1</th>
		<th>
		    Argument 2</th>

		    <b>ptv_num</b>
		    <br />
		    (Transfer Number)</td>
	    </tr>
	</tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
	e.g. if you wished to output the total employee ordinary contributions for investment
	fund 2, you would enter pdh_tee_ordc(2). 
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    Added 'UK/Irish Scheme' indicator on <i>Scheme File Maintenance</i> to allow the masking
    of irrelevant fields to the UK or Irish market. This will also be required for the
    calculation of State Pension Date. 
</li>
<li>
    Added a State Pension Date to the <i>Member Basic Record</i> which will automatically
    calculate a members SPD depending on their Date of Birth and Sex. This calculation
    will be carried out to all existing members on installation on this version of Pension
    Master and takes into account the change of State Pension Ages for women born after
    6 April 1950 (UK). 
</li>
<li>
    Added a new screen <i>Member Indicators</i> to <i>Member File Maintenance</i>. This
    shows whether various records exist for each member or not. There is also a Number
    field for Additional Benefits and Transfer Received records to show the user how many
    of these records are present. The records analysed by this indicator screen are as
    follows: 
    <ul>
	<li>
	    Part time hours 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Benefit normination received/dependent records 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Freehand Notes 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Salary history 
	</li>
	<li>
	    AVC's present 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Additional benefits 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Transfer in received 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Address 
	</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
	This record also holds the Ratio 1 and Ratio 2 amounts and a new field to record NI
	Table (UK Schemes only). 
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    Due to the addition of the State Pension Date field and the addition of the <i>Member
    Indicators</i> record, the <i>Member Basic Details</i> screen has been slightly reorganised.
    This allows for fuller descriptions of each field on-screen. Any fields that used
    to be on this screen and are not there now, have been moved to the new <i>Member Indicators</i> screen. 
</li>
<li>
    The amendment of Company, Category and Status details on the <i>Member Basic Record</i> have
    been tightened up to try to establish a more complete history which will allow users
    to produce accurate <i>Membership Movement Summaries</i> when required. When adding
    a member, if the user does not enter a Deate Entered Scheme they will be warned that
    this date is required for the Company, Category and Status Histories and prompted
    to check that they wish to leave this date blank. If they do leave the date blank,
    they will be forced to enter an effective date of change before they will be allowed
    to accept the member details. When updating a member, if the Company, Category or
    Status fields are amended then the user will be prompted to enter an effective date
    of change before they will be allowed to move on to the next field. 
</li>
<li>
    When running calculations from <i>Bulk Quotation Run</i> or from <i>Member File Maintenance</i>,
    the Unit Bid Price field will automatically be set to N for defined benefits schemes. 
</li>
<li>
    Extended the selection criterea in <i>Batch Quotation Run</i> to allow selection using
    Special Codes. 
</li>
<li>
    Amended the 'Retire at end of month' field on the <i>Category File Maintenance</i> to
    'Normal Pension Date Adjustment'. Using the available codes you can set the categories
    NRD to be: 
    <ul>
	<li>
	    the exact day of the member reaching NRA (N) 
	</li>
	<li>
	    the first day of that month (S) 
	</li>
	<li>
	    the last day of that month (E) 
	</li>
	<li>
	    the last day of the previous month (P) 
	</li>
	<li>
	    the first day of the following month (F) 
	</li>
	<li>
	    a fixed day in the month (D) 
	</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
	If any of your categories are currently set up with the 'Retire at end of month' as
	Y, the installation program will automatically convert this to the correct new code
	(E). 
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    Replaced the <i>User Defined Amounts</i> and <i>User Defined Dates</i> screens with
    new, more flexible screens that allow you to customise them as you wish. You can now
    set up as many <i>User Defined Screens</i> and <i>User Defined Arrays</i> as you wish
    rather than being limited to one screen of values and one screen of dates as used
    to be in <i>Pension Master</i>. These screens can easily be customised as the user
    requires so that you can hold any conceivable item of data. 
</li>
<li>
    <i>User Defined Screens</i> will allow users to set up their own screens with up to
    twenty fields. Each field is set up with a format of any one of the following: 
    <ul>
	<li>
	    Date (DT) 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Indicator (IN) 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Numeric Integer (NI) 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Numeric Decimal (ND) 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Header (HD) 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Text (TX) 
	</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
	This then enables the system to validate the users input onto the screen in a members
	record e.g. the system will not allow a date to be entered in a field set up as an
	indicator. 
	<br />
	<i>User Defined Arrays</i> follows the same principle except it shows a historical
	list of up to five columns with the same format controls as User Defined Screens.
	The only exception to this is that the use of Header types are not allowed in <i>User
	Defined Arrays</i>. 
	<br />
	These screens are displayed in the menu selection screen with the screen description
	and can therefore be accessed directly rather than having to select the User Defined
	Screen option then having to select the particular screen that you want. Only the
	screens and arrays that exist for the scheme of the member selected will be displayed
	on the menu selection list and similarly on the member report screen selection. 
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    Added new menu option under <i>System Data</i> called <i>User Defined Messages</i>.
    This will allow users to set up more meaningful and specific warning messages that
    they can use in formulae. The messages can be up to 50 characters long and are selected
    in formulae using the syntax 'mess(n)' where n is the number allocated to each message.
    An F8 lookup is available within <i>Formula File Maintenance</i> when you enter mess
    at the start of a formula line. This will display a list of the available messages
    and, when the relevant message has been selected, the system writes back to the formula
    line the required code in the correct format. <b>* Systems Administrators will need
    to add this menu option to menu listings and users accounts (see attached notes).</b> 
</li>
<li>
    Allow formula codes to be up to 8 characters long rather than the old 3 characters.
    Also, check to make sure that the user does not embed spaces in the formula code. 
</li>
<li>
    Amended the prints generated from the <i>Member Contributions Screen</i> to show Totals
    To Renewal Date less 1 day and Totals To Date. 
</li>
<li>
    Added a new screen <i>Additional Benefits</i> to <i>Member File Maintenance</i>. This
    record differs from a Transfer-in as a Fixed Benefit or a Service amount the member
    has received from the scheme or a scheme which comes under the same scheme unmbrella
    e.g. service in a scheme that has merged into the current scheme, strike periods.
    These benefits must be entered against a Benefit Code which must be set up under <i>Additional
    Benefit Codes Maintenance</i> which is a new option in the <i>System Data</i> sub
    menu. <b>* Systems Administrators will need to add this menu option to menu listings
    and users accounts (see attached notes).</b> 
</li>
<li>
    Amended the report print from <i>Category File Maintenance</i> to number the <i>Quotation
    Type</i> results on the output. This should help users if they wish to refer to previous
    results in formulae by displaying the result number rather than the user having to
    count down the list. 
</li>
<li>
    <p>Renamed GMP functions within <i>Formula File Maintenance</i> as follows:</p>
	    <table cellspacing="0">

		    <tr>

			    Old Name</th>

	The <i>Pension Master</i> upgrade program automatically coverts any references to
	the old style functions to the new names in any of your formulae that currently use
	these functions. The revised help text for these new functions is as follows: 
    </p>
    <p><b>pre_88_gmp_exit</b></p>
<p><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>
<p>Use the pre_88_gmp_exit function to calculate
    the amount of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) accrued prior to 6 April 1988 at
    termination of service. 
</p>

<p><b>SYNTAX</b></p>
<p>pre_88_gmp_exit</p>

<p><b>NOTES</b></p>
<ol>
<li>If the members Date of Birth is blank, this function will return erroneous results and an error message will be displayed to the screen informing you of this if it happens for any member you are running quotes for.</li>
<li>The function calculates GMP to date using Quotation Termination Date.</li>
<li>If any required Section 148 orders are not on Pension Master, 
    you will be warned of this and you should then add them to 
    Pension Master using the Section 148 Order File Maintenance 
    module.</li>
</ol>


<p><b>EXAMPLES</b> pre_88_gmp_exit</p>

<p><b>pre_88_gmp_npd(p)</b></p>
<p><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>
<p>Use the pre_88_gmp_npd function to calculate the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) accrued prior to 6 April 1988, revalued to State Pension Age or to Normal Retirement Date, if later.</p>

<p><b>SYNTAX</b></p>
<p>pre_88_gmp_npd(p)</p>

<p><b>EXPLANATION</b></p>
<p>p - is a single character field that denotes the type of GMP revaluation as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>L - Limited rate revaluation</li>
<li>F - Fixed rate revaluation</li>
<li>S - Section 148 orders. These are assumed to be the same as for Fixed Rate revaluation.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NOTES</b></p>
<ol>
<li>If Normal Retirement Date is later than State Pension Date then the GMP is revalued up to State Pension Date using Fixed, Limited or Section 148 orders, and between State Pension Date and Normal Retirement Date at 1/7% per week, providing the period between State Pension Date and Normal Pension Date is at least seven weeks.
</li>
</ol>


<p><b>EXAMPLES</b> pre_88_gmp_npd(L) pre_88_gmp_npd(F) pre_88_gmp_npd(S)</p>

<p><b>post_88_gmp_exit</b></p>

<p><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>

<p>Use the post_88_gmp_exit function to calculate the amount of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension
    (GMP) accrued after 6 April 1988 at termination of service.</p>


<b>SYNTAX </b>post_88_gmp_exit 


<b>NOTES </b>1.
    If the members Date of Birth is blank, this function will return 
    erroneous results and an error message will be displayed to the 
    screen informing you of this if it happens for any member you 
    are running quotes for. 2. The function calculates GMP to date using
    Quotation Termination Date. 3. 
    If any required Section 148 orders are not on Pension Master, 
    you will be warned of this and you should then add them to 
    Pension Master using the Section 148 Order File Maintenance 
    module. 


<b>EXAMPLES </b>post_88_gmp_exit <b>post_88_gmp_npd(p) 


OVERVIEW </b>Use
    the post_88_gmp_npd function to calculate the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) accrued
    after 6 April 1988, revalued to State Pension Age or to Normal Retirement Date, if
    later. 


<b>SYNTAX </b>post_88_gmp_npd(p) 


<b>EXPLANATION </b>p&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    is a single character field that denotes the type of GMP &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    revaluation as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; L - Limited
    rate revaluation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F - Fixed rate revaluation
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S - Section 148 orders. These are
    assumed to be the same as &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for Fixed
    Rate revaluation. 


<b>NOTES </b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Normal Retirement Date is later
    than State Pension Date then &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the GMP is revalued up
    to State Pension Date using Fixed, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limited or Section
    148 orders, and between State Pension Date &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Normal
    Retirement Date at 1/7% per week, providing the period &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    between State Pension Date and Normal Pension Date is at least seven &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    weeks. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full allowance is made for increases in the Post 88 GMP
    once past &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State Pension Date. This is done via references
    to the System Factor &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table INFLA. If the appropriate
    factor cannot be found in the INFLA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table, it will
    be assumed to be at the rate of 3% per annum and a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    warning message informing you of which tax years this has been&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    assumed will be written to the Quotation Warnings file.

    <p>
	When the user first selects the <i>Quotations Screen</i> they are presented with a
	pop-up picklist of all the available quotations for the current member. Simply use
	the arrow keys to select the required quotation and press <i>Return</i> to view the
	details. 
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    Allow the user to write the results of finalised quotations back to the member record.
    This is done by setting up a <i>User Defined Screen</i> to hold the details you wish
    to write back from you quotations. e.g. you might set up a <i>User Defined Screen</i> called
    'REFUND' to hold details of the results of refund of contributions calculations that
    have been finalised. In this screen you would set up each field that you wish to hold
    data for e.g. net refund, tax payable, state premium payable. These fields <b>must</b> be
    set up as numeric decimal (ND) fields so as they can correctly display your calculation
    results. 
</li>
<li>
    Added new fields <i>WRITE</i> and <i>NUM</i> to the <i>Benefit Definitions</i> screen
    of <i>Category File Maintenance</i>. These are to be used in conjunction with finalising
    quotations (see previous section for further details). The <i>WRITE</i> field indicates
    which <i>User Defined Screen</i> you wish to write the results of the current formula
    back to when quotes are finalised for this <i>Quotation Type</i> e.g. you would enter
    'REFUND', following on from the example in the previous section. The <i>NUM</i> field
    indicates which field on the <i>User Defined Screen</i> you wish to write the results
    of the current formulae to e.g. if you wish to write the result of the new refund
    of contributions back to the first field on the 'REFUND' screen, enter '1' in the <i>NUM</i> field. 
</li>
<li>
    Amended the <i>Member Report</i> and <i>Full Member Listing</i> so that the user can
    now define up to two lines of column heading for each field that is to be output to
    the report. This has necessitated the re-arrangement of the second screen of each
    of these reports. The column headings default to the appropriate values that have
    been set up on the <i>Member Report Units</i> module and can be overwritten by the
    user. These are then saved with the report for future use. 
</li>
<li>
    Added a <i>Delete</i> option to the <i>Member Report</i> so that the user can delete
    existing reports without having to use the old <i>Report Maintenance</i> module which
    was separate from the <i>Member Report</i>. 
</li>
<li>
    <p>Amended some of the menu options in the <i>Member Report</i> as follows:</p>
	    <table cellspacing="0">

<li>
    Added a new function called <i>addben(code) </i>which will allow users to extract
    the appropriate benefit from an <i>Additional Benefit</i> record. Depending on the
    second character of the code the function will return the amount of Fixed Benefit
    or Added Service to the formula. The manual page for this is as follows: <pre><b>addben(code) </u>OVERVIEW </b>Use
    this function to extract a members additional benefit depending on the&nbsp; benefit
    code. <b>SYNTAX </b>addben(code) <b>EXPLANATION </b>code&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a reference
    to the Benefit Code of the Additional Benefit record that you wish to select the benefit
    from. <b>NOTES</b></pre>
    <ol>
	<li>
	    This function will return the Additional Benefit depending on the code entered. If
	    the second character of the code is a "F" then the value of the Fixed Benefit for
	    that code will be returned. If the second character of the code is a "S" then the
	    value of the Added Years + Added Months / 12 + Added Days / 365 will be returned.

    Added new menu option under <i>System Data</i> called <i>Annual Statutory Amounts</i>.
    This will allow users to record the annual amounts of Single Persons Basic State Pension,
    Married Persons Basic State Pension, Widowed Persons Basic State Pension,
    Disabled Persons Basic State Pension, Basic State Pension Effective Date, Lower Earnings
    Limit, Upper Earnings Limit and The Earnings Cap for each year. <b>* Systems Administrators
    will need to add this menu option to menu listings and users accounts (see attached
    notes).</b> 
</li>
<li>
    Added a new function called <i>stat(fld1,fld2,date)</i>which will allow users to extract
    the appropriate statutory amount from the <i>Annual Statutory Amounts</i> table. The
    manual page for this is as follows: <pre><b>stat(fld1,fld2,date) </u>OVERVIEW </b>Use
    the stat function to select amounts from the Annual Statutory Amounts record given
    the type and effective date. <b>SYNTAX </b>stat(fld1,fld2,date) <b>EXPLANATION </b>fld1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is used to denote the statutory amount type and can take the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    fld2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the effective date selector.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Valid values (for fld1 = 's' or 'm') are 'y', which will select&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    the effective amount at the 6th April prior to date, and 'd', which&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    will select the effective amount at the BSP effective date prior&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    to date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Valid values (for fld1 = 'l',
    'u' or 'e') are 'y', which will select&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    the effective amount at the 6th April prior to date (1st Jan. for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    The existing <i>max(hist_field,n)</i> and <i>min(hist_field,n)</i> have been dropped
    as the first function can be handled by the <i>avgmax(fld,n1,n2)</i> function and
    the second function is no longer relevant. These codes have been reused to allow the
    calculation of the greater or lower of two fields. The manual pages for these new
    codes are as follows: <pre><b>max(fld1,fld2) </u>OVERVIEW </b>Use the max function
    to calculate the greater of two selected fields. <b>SYNTAX </b>max(fld1,fld2) <b>EXPLANATION </b>fld1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Added a new function called <i>special_code_field(code)</i> which will allow users
    to condition a jump to relevant sections of a formula depending on a special code.
    The manual page for this new code is as follows: <pre><b>special_code_field(code) </u>OVERVIEW </b>Use
    this function to condition a jump to relevant sections of a formula&nbsp; depending
    on a special code. The full syntax follows a similar picture&nbsp;&nbsp; as the 'goto'

    is a reference to the Special Code you wish to condition&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    against. special_code&nbsp; should match the 'code' entry. ln&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    condition is true. <b>NOTES</b></pre>
    <ol>
	<li>
	    'code' must be a valid Special Code as set up in Special Codes Maintenance. The system
	    will prompt you if an incorrect code is entered. 
	</li>
	<li>
	    Any operator can be used although equals '=' and not equals '!' will be ones most

    Amended the <i>pen_act_proj()</i> function in <i>Formula File Maintenance</i> as follows: <pre><b>pen_act_proj(reval_rate) </u>OVERVIEW </b>Use
    the pen_act function to calculate the fraction required under the&nbsp; Irish Pensions
    Act for leavers from a Final Salary pension scheme with deferred benefits. This fraction
    is used to calculate the member's pension on leaving the scheme, but revalued to normal
    pension age. <b>SYNTAX </b>pen_act_proj(reval_rate) <b>EXPLANATION </b>reval_rate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    is the rate of revaluation to be assumed for projection &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    purposes. Legislation dictates this is 4%p.a. or the&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    increase in the CPI if less. Enter any rate you require here, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    including rates with a decimal point e.g. 2.5% <b>NOTES </b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date
    of leaving the scheme is calculated as follows:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Date Left (on the first screen of Member File) is
    available, use &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    otherwise, use Quotation Termination Date. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amount of the
    revaluation is applied between the date of leaving&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    the scheme (as calculated in 1. above) (or 1/1/96 if later) and&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    normal pension date. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The revaluation rate used for the projection
    will be that supplied &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the reval_rate argument to
    the function. <b>EXAMPLES</b>&nbsp; pen_act_proj(3) pen_act_proj(3.25)</pre>
</li>
<li>
    When printing out a <i>Quotation Screen</i> in <i>Member File Maintenance</i>, if
    notes exist on the <i>Member Notes</i> screen for that member, print a message at
    the foot of the report warning the user of this and suggesting that they check the
    notes to make sure nothing of relevance to the quotes exists for this member. 
</li>

<p>
Future Developments
</p></b> 
<p>
The following list will detail some of the planned changes to Pension Master in the
future. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Only display Quotation Types relevant to the members current status. This would be
    controlled in the Quotation Types screen in Category File Maintenance by a code that
    would match the members' status type e.g. A - Actives. Only members currently with
    this status type would have this Quotation Type displayed. A code of G would be created
    as a global code which would allow the Quotation Type to be available to all status
    types. 
</li>
<li>
    Allow write back of status and leaving date on finalising Quotation results. This
    would work in a similar way to the above except when the user tried to finalise the
    Quotation results, they would be presented with a pop up list of applicable status
    codes in the specified status type group. 
</li>
<li>
    Ability to cope with monetary values in an EMU currency. 
</li>
<li>
    Data Clean reports. This would be released in a basic form initially and will warn
    users of missing or conflicting member data. 
</li>
<li>
    Allow the deletion of individual records for a member e.g. salary details, rather
    than the complete record. 
</li>
<li>
    Allow historic interest and factor tables. This would enable Quotations to be run
    using interest rates and factors relevant to the quote date. 
</li>
</ul>
