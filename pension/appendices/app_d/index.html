<h2 id="a-nameintroductionaintroduction"><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This note describes the in-built support for the Euro in Pension Master.</p>

<p>The Euro becomes a currency in it’s own right with effect from 1/1/1999. Euro notes
and coins will not be circulated until 1/1/2002 and in the <em>transition period</em> (which
runs from 1/1/1999 to 31/12/2001) transactions may be carried out in either the Euro
or the <em>National Currency Unit</em> (NCU) e.g. Irish Punts or Pounds Sterling.</p>

<p>Companies can opt to continue operating in their NCU for their businesses and accounts
until 31/12/2001 or can switch to operating in Euro currency at any time between 1/1/1999
and 31/12/2001.</p>

<h2 id="a-namebasecurrencyabase-currency"><a name="base_currency"></a>Base Currency</h2>

<p>This is sometimes known as the ‘lead currency’ and denotes the currency unit in which
Pension Master processes and stores information. It is anticipated that this will
normally be the NCU.</p>

<h2 id="a-nameimplementationoftheeuroaimplementation-of-the-euro"><a name="implementation_of_the_euro"></a>Implementation of the Euro</h2>

<p>We have implemented support for the Euro in the following ways:</p>

<h3 id="a-namesystemparametersasystem-parameters"><a name="system_parameters"></a>System Parameters</h3>

<p>We have introduced a new field ‘<a href="/pension/system_administration/pem_sysp/">Default Base Currency</a>’
to the first screen of this program. This holds the 3 letter code for the default
base currency e.g. IEP represents Irish Punts, GBP represents Pounds Sterling. A lookup
of the valid currency codes is available in this field, just click on the ‘Serach’
button and these codes are based on internationally accepted standards used in the
money markets.</p>

<h3 id="a-nameschemesaschemes"><a name="schemes"></a>Schemes</h3>

<p>We have introduced a new field ‘<a href="/pension/file_maintenance/pem_sch/">Base Currency</a>’ to the first
screen of this program. This holds the 3 letter code for the base currency to be used
for this scheme e.g. IEP represents Irish Punts. A lookup of the valid currency codes
is available in this field, just click on the lookup icon and these codes are
based on internationally accepted standards used in the money markets.</p>

<p>This field will default to the ‘Default Base Currency’ as set out in the section ‘System
Parameters’ above.</p>

<p>The field will initially be set to the default base currency for all schemes. As and
when each scheme opts to switch to the Euro, the user will update this field to ‘EUR’
(the international symbol for the Euro). They will then be prompted that all monetary
values for this scheme are to be converted from the NCU to Euro and that this process
in not reversible. They will be asked whether they have an up to date backup of the
current scheme data and if not, given an opportunity to exit the change and take a
backup. Once this has been done, all monetary amounts for the scheme, including <strong>all</strong> membership
data and historical unit prices for that scheme will be converted to Euro’s.</p>

<p>Values held in <a href="/pension/system_data/pem_stf/">Annual Statutory Amounts</a> remain
in the same currency as the system default base currency as defined in <a href="/pension/system_administration/pem_sysp/#Basic System Parameters">System
Parameters</a>. The values should only be converted over to
Euro’s at the end of the transitional period i.e. when all your schemes are obliged
by law to make the Euro their base currency. Any values retrieved from the <a href="/pension/system_data/pem_stf/">Annual
Statutory Amounts</a> table by means of the <a href="/pension/file_maintenance/calculation_setup/pem_form9/#10">stat()</a> formula
function are automatically converted on the fly into the scheme base currency so as
to ensure consistency with your scheme formulae.</p>

<p>The reason that the conversion to Euro process is not reversible is that when a monetary
value is converted from the NCU to Euro and then back into the NCU, inevitable rounding
errors will occur and thus the resulting data will not be the same as it was before
it was originally converted to Euro’s.</p>

<p>At the end of the transition period, European law states that the NCU will become
an obsolete currency, so all schemes that still have the NCU as their base currency
should be converted over to Euro’s following the above procedure.</p>

<h3 id="a-namemembersamembers"><a name="members"></a>Members</h3>

<p>All screens containing monetary values now have an additional two fields at the top
of the screen which show the currency code and description of the currency that the
data is held in i.e. the base currency.</p>

<p>The user can toggle between the NCU and Euro in these screens by using the ‘Toggle
Euro’ button in Pension Master.</p>

<p>The above principles also apply to other areas of the scheme data that hold monetary
values e.g. the scheme level user defined fields in <a href="/pension/file_maintenance/pem_sch/#Scheme User Defined Details">Schemes</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-nameformulaeaformulae"><a name="formulae"></a>Formulae</h3>

<p>We have introduced two new functions ncu_to_eur() and eur_to_ncu() which take a monetary
value and convert this from the NCU to Euro and from the Euro to NCU respectively.</p>

<p>It is anticipated that whilst the scheme is still using the NCU (i.e. before it has
opted to switch to the Euro), all calculations will be done in the NCU and merely
converted to Euro’s by the addition of extra formulae that each take the result of
a benefit calculation and apply ncu_to_eur() in order to convert the value into Euro’s.
Thus the result of each calculation in both the NCU and Euro will be available for
output to any benefit statement or certificate.</p>

<p>Once the scheme has opted to switch to the Euro, and whilst still within the transition
period, all monetary values and calculations within Pension Master will be in Euro’s.
The Euro will now become the default currency for the scheme. The above procedure
can be applied in reverse using the eur_to_ncu() function to convert calculated results
from Euro’s into NCU for output to benefit statements and certificates.</p>

<h3 id="a-nameannualstatutoryamountsaannual-statutory-amounts"><a name="annual_statutory_amounts"></a>Annual Statutory Amounts</h3>

<p>This program now has an additional two fields at the top of the screen which show the
currency code and description of the currency that the data is held in i.e. the base
currency. <strong>The values held on this table are in the same currency as the system
default base currency which is held in <a href="/pension/system_administration/pem_sysp/#Basic System Parameters">System
Parameters</a>.</strong></p>

<p>The user can toggle between the NCU and Euro in these screens by using the ‘Toggle
Euro’ button in Pension Master.</p>

<p>When using the <a href="/pension/file_maintenance/calculation_setup/pem_form9/#10">stat()</a> function in formulae, 
if the scheme base currency for the scheme that the member is in is different than
the system default base currency, all values returned by stat() are automatically
converted into the scheme base currency and a message written to the Quotation Warnings
File informing you of the conversion.</p>

<p>At the end of the transitional period, you should ensure that the default base currency
field in <a href="/pension/system_administration/pem_sysp/">System Parameters</a> is changed to ‘EUR’
as this process also converts over the values held in the <a href="/pension/system_data/pem_stf/">Annual
Statutory Amounts</a> table to Euro’s.</p>
