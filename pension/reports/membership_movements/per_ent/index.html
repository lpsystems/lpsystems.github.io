<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This program produces a report of members who have joined between two dates entered
by the user.</p>

<p>This is especially useful when producing membership movements summaries for a scheme
and will show full details of all the individuals who were new entrants during the
specified period.</p>

<p>The following options and screen appear when this program is selected:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Proceed</li>
  <li>Exit</li>
</ul>

<div class="screen">
